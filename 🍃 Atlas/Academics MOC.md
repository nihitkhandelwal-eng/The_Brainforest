### Anki Workflow
- I will be doing my anki mostly on my laptop/desktop
- Adding to notes
	1. Open OneNote
	2. Copy Paste in OneNote's pre-made categories
	3. Add the tag "important by either using the button at the top or pressing Ctrl+1" (this hotkey can also be used to remove the tag)
	4. Open iPad whenever I want to add to notes
	5. Open OneNote & GoodNotes in [[iPad Hotkeys#^36a7cc|split screen]] 
	6. On OneNote, search for "important", this will give us all the notes with the tag, i.e. with notes to add
	7. Add them
	8. Voila!
- Every time I come across a card, I want to add to my notes, I will press Ctrl+7
