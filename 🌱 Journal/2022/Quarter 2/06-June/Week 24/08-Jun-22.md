### Morning Pages
- Khichdi dahi is just the best, I am thinking of eating this for the next 7 days straight.
    - I think it is helping me reduce weight & get better motions
- Been reading up the introductions in the forum, lot of religious people out there, there is one Indian guy from hyderabad, some upper caste male who is also a doctor, who is all about indian sprituality & culture & ancient wisdom.
    - As expected the western people are going all ga-ga over it.

### Good Morning
- Had an army nightmare, which was out of context but then had some college people in it.

    - Speaking of improve, I can add this as a query, in my weekly note, where I can find all things where I say, "improve" "should" or something like that. #todo
- I am going to study for 10 hours!!
- One phrase to rule them all → Extremely-sincere
