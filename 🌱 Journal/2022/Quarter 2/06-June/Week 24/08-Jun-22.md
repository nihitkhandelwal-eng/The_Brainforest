### Anki Algorithm
- Learning v/s Graduated
	- Once a card completes it's steps it's graduated 
	- Every card has a starting ease of 250%
		- Everything you do, after the card graduates, will affect the ease
		- It won't be affected if the card is in learning phase, no matter how many time you hit again.
