### Connect
- 01:40 → Talked with Anne about "culture", Ben believing in Magic, Ashley believing that she is a witch & Anne getting flabbergasted by the fact that everybody's is hating America right now.
	- There is this tendency to respect every culture, no matter how crazy it is.
	- Due to this foundational issue of "respecting others" & their beliefs, no matter how fucked up they are, she will respect anything.
	- I gave her an example: If I say that I see a teapot in the solar system, to which I pray to every night at 03:29, I pour down water from my roof & it gives me good wealth & positive vibrations.
		- What would you say to that?
		- She said, that she would go "good for you that you found something that worked for you" #placeholder/argument #placeholder/irrational
