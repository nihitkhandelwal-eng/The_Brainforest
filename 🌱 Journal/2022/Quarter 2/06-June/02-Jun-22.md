### Day In Review
- I slept at 5, after Nannu reached his room.
    - He is going through a potential breakup, she called him to Jaipur to ask for a break, which essentially menas a breakup. 
- Woke up at 12, Aanya was still fighing with everyone, which was most likely because things were not very good between me & her.
    - So, I sorted that out, I have been doing that for 2 hours now.

- Also, I am hooked on to [[Mere Banne Ki Baat Na Poocho]]
Let's start studying at this very moment.
