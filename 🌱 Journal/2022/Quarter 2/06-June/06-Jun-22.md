### Day In Review
- Moma Daddy left at 5, Nannu at 9. At this point, Aanya came to me & yelled "Emergency! Aapke Bhai Jaa Rhe Hai".
- I would like to nip this planning thing in the bud today, so yeah!

I think I am doing good & do not need to adjust course

### Connect
- 11:49 → Played with Aanya & Vihaan for 45 minutes in the morning.

### Consume
- 11:50 → Watched the lallantop interview of Panchayat's Team. Deepak Mishra (The Rowdies Guy), Chandan Kumar (Writer of Tech Conversations with Dad ft. Gajraj Rao & Jeetu) & ARUNABH KUMAR, haven't seen him after the sexual harrasment allegations against him.
    - Also, TVF Pitchers is in works!

- Apart from this, it's only [[Mere Banne Ki Baat Na Poocho]]

### Cerebrate
- 12:24 → Nannu is much more objective than me, he thinks better, analyzes better & counters himself better.
    - He counters himself on most occasions
    - He actually thinks, if someone really thinks, they know how hard it is & how taxing it is.
    - I have not done that in a long time.
