### Good Morning
Slept at 1:45 while listening to [[Mehengai Dayan Khaye Jaat Hai]] & then Vihaan woke me up at 08:00, but Aanya did not want to wake me up, so yeahhhh!
Had my back aching, so I asked baby aanya to stand on my back, then aanya bought her baby monkey soap, to show me & then rubbed it on me, while I was still on my gadda.
- Very excited about the welcome call with the LYT Team at 21:30.
