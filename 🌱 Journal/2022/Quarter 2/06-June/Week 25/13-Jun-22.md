### Good Morning
Slept at 1:45 while listening to [[Mehengai Dayan Khaye Jaat Hai]] & then Vihaan woke me up at 08:00, but Aanya did not want to wake me up, so yeahhhh!
Had my back aching, so I asked baby aanya to stand on my back, then aanya bought her baby monkey soap, to show me & then rubbed it on me, while I was still on my gadda.
- Very excited about the welcome call with the LYT Team at 21:30.
- One phrase to rule them all → Never-Give-Up
- I can be cautious about
    - I am really really worried about baby georgie coming in my room all day & sitting in my lap, then asking for baby horsey, then playing with me, it will be all fun but I also want to study & baby chotu has nothing to do today.
- I would set an alarm, so that me & baby georgie will only play at break time, it will be in 50 minutes & then 10 minute break.
- Eagle's eye view → Get on with it & don't procrastinate
- Daring Task → Study for 6 hours
