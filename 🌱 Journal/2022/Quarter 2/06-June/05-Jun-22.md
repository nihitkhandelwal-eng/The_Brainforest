### Good Morning
I was having a terrible headache yesterday, so slept early at 20:30.
    - These days I am doing the papa way, i.e. sleeping on a single mattress which also is very thin, so woke up at 04:00 but had a nightmare ridden sleep.
Nannu is coming from Delhi & Daddy-Moma from Sikar, so yes I am excited about eating tossin pizza or taco bell!
One phrase to rule them all → Happy
If anyone finds out that I have not actually studied pathoma, but that is unlikely since, Nannu also studies in that manner, where he does not annotate, so it should not be a problem. 
Eagle's eye view → undefined
