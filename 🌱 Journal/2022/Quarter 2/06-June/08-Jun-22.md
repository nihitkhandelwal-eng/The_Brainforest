### Good Morning
- Had an army nightmare, which was out of context but then had some college people in it.
-  Slept at 1:30 & woke up at 9:30, that's been happening for a long time now, I wake up when Shipra Didi is about to go & then she has to clean my room before leaving, will improve this thing.
    - Speaking of improve, I can add this as a query, in my weekly note, where I can find all things where I say, "improve" "should" or something like that. #todo
I am going to study for 10 hours!!
One phrase to rule them all → Extremely-sincere
I can be cautious about
    - Nothing can stop me today
Eagle's eye view → Done is better than perfection & you are not even going for perfection, it's procrastination is what you are doing.
If I study for 4 hours, the sheldon in me can say, boldly go! Howard & then when I finish my 8 hours, the wolowitz in me can say, "he is a genius"
