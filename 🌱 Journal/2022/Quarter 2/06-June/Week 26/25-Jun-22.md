### The Origin of Panda
![[The Rise of Baby Panda]]

### The Most Dangerous Writing App
This was an exercise given by [[Bianca Pereira]] in [[Bianca Pereira's Session 1]]

What is your research about?

I am very nervous or somewhat bloated, I am confused. The music playing in the LYT video is distracting, but I am afraid to leave the keyboard & see all I wrote disappear. I will still try it.

Yeah!!! DID IT.

Talking about my research, but I first want to clarify that I ate very spicy noodles just now & I am not very comfortable stomach wise.

About my research, I don't have any particular research. I am write now learning about PKM from the LYT workshop & I am thinking critically about it, to create meaningful knowledge, so technically it is research.

I am also studying Pathoma for USMLE Step 1, which technically speaking I haven't studied in more that a week but that's what I am telling at home.

So, in that part I can be considered as a decent researcher.
Now, talking about my studies is not a comfortable feeling for me, since I feel that I am letting everyone down. Especially my parents & Bhai. Also me.

I am positive that I will start it from Monday, I say that a lot. In fact I have been saying that for the past 3 years now.

But seriously, I need to catch up with the workshop, right now I am at my 3rd guide session of week 1.

So, by the end of tomorrow, oh by the way, while writing this I feel that this would be my journal for today & it is kind of fun writing like this, there is no time for doubting myself & my writing & in the process I write, without thinking about structure of any kind. I can truly feel that this way, structure will have to be earned, there is no other way.

So by the end of tomorrow, I will need to finish everything before Rok Sanda's 2nd session which will happen on Monday.

This will then include
Rok Sanda's 1st Session
Super Session 2
Sensemaking Session 2
Unit 2 Curriculum
Eleanor Konik's Session 2
Sana A Ahmed's Session 2
Bianca Pereira's Session 2

This is a lot but definitely not impossible, by the way, I forgot the spelling of impossible for a moment. Yeah, so it is achievable, I need good focus & I need to be intentional for tomorrow.

Talking of being intentional, I am really looking forward to implement Mami style working pattern starting this Monday, where I won't be watching any entertainment on weekdays, I will be collecting the stuff throughout the week but I won't watch it or read it till weekend, this way I would have earned my leisure time, much like my structure, which I am going to earn soon.

This marks the end of my 10 minutes, really enjoyed writing here, I am going to do it more frequently from now on.
