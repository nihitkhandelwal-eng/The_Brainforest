### Good Morning
Slept good, I don’t think I had any nightmare, woke up in between & finally at 09:00 with Aanya as my pillow, played with her for about 45 minutes, then went to washroom for about 30 minutes, because of the stomach pain & loose motion.

- I can finally start my studies on my term!
- One phrase to rule them all → Decent
- I can be cautious about
    - My tendency to procrastinate is something I am growing fearful of day-by-day but I think I will beat it today.
- Eagle's eye view → I shouldn't waste any more time, things are finally going my way, I should try to keep it that way
- Studying for 6 hours is a bold task for today
