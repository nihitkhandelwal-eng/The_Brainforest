### Day In Review
So far, very laid back, had a big play session with Aanya in the morning after she woke me up by saying, Emergency! Jacky is going to win!

- Then, played carom with Aanya & showed her trick shots (juice pibbanoo)
- Then baby AC's operation was due today, so that took place, aanya wrote a letter to the principal of baby's AC that he won't be coming to school for the next 7 days.
- She is now journaling sitting next to me.
I am going to start studying immediately now!!
