### Lazy Morning
Woke up at 10:00 & very lazy, don't feel like doing the whole morning journal thing from ipad, so added a task to create a quickadd macro out of it, that should be good!

I can't get over the fact that howard dies & that too, killed by lalo, I am not liking Jimmy & Kim now. Will have to wait till July 12 when the next episode comes out

Starting with pathoma today, so as to complete the target for starting the paperwork for my loan.

- Will probably not do day planner today, since I am already doing it in Marvin. This duplicitiy of apps is something I would like to eliminate in the future.

### Note to next day’s self
> [!tip] Reminder
> Dear [[Thursday]] Nihit,
> Not so weird today, have done this earlier but today feels like a good day to do this.
> I was extremely focused today, did pathoma non stop for quite some time.
> ![[File_000.png|wide]]
> Kind of sloughed off after 19:30, could have reduced the break which is now more than 3 hours long
> Studying today was the best feeling I had about myself in months, I really do enjoy a good lecture, so cherish it, don't run away from it.
> 
> 
> You are good, 
> First Time Productive Nihit

Not doing the whole day planner thing, since I am limiting this to Marvin & Productivity Challenge Timer
