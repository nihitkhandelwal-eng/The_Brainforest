I want to have a PKM that is unique to my thought process. I am a very passionate reader, learner & a very dedicated medical student. I am extremely passionate about so many things in various domains but if I don't have a PKM which can cater to such a vast variety of things, it all feels like a pointless exercise, the outcome of which are mostly in the short run.
There was never a time like this before, with the advent of tools like Obsidian, I am hoping to create a vault, not just for myself, for my family, friends & specially the medical community, which can definitely use smart PKM which I hope that this course will teach.
