### Need to go back to Mirtaz
- Slept late at 03:30 & woke up 7 hours later 
- Had a nightmare about her
- Solved a fight between the kids
- Talking to Christiann on gather town
- I am still not doing the ipad journal thing since there are friction points
	- Syncing to & from github
	- Resolving conflicts
	- Deletability of the dictated text

### Pathoma Plan (Again)
The 10 day plan [[23-May-22#Pathoma Rundown|Pathoma Rundown]] is not very practical so, I am revising it.

> [!summary]  Complete Pathoma in 20 days 
> This was suggested by Nannu as it ensures a timely completion of Pathoma, simultaneously making way for time to read First Aid as well
> 
> My study hours will be good & for keeping me accountable & to also keep a check on me, so that I don't misuse my time, I will be sharing my daily study updates with the family.
> So  17 days from now i.e. 15th June is when I will be completing my Pathoma, along with as much first aid I can do.
> 
> I should have reconsidered when Moma said "think about what you are saying, 2nd june is almost there"
> But as long as I am studying for a sincere amount of hours, I see no reason for me to not achieve this.
