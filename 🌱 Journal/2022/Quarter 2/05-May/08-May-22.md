### Moma & Mami Talked
After my outburst last night about Vihaan saying "Main papa se complaint karoonga aapki, ki aapko aur maare aur ab aapko bachane wala koi nahi hoga" to Mami, I basically called for severe punishment of Mama & called him a few words.

Moma talked to Mami & they will be meeting in gurgaon next weekend, I won't be going, it's only the big adults.

Moma also told Mami that I was tensed about all this & so as a result, Mami is acting a bit formal with me today.

### USMLE Again
Moma had a talk with me about me doing NEET PG just because everyone says so.
Why not USMLE?

Last I remember, I left the idea because of her staying in India & so, I saw no future there, but now I can see a good life in the USA
