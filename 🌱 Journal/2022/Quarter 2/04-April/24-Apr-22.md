### Day in Review

- Felt: ðŸ¥³ Happy
	- Very long conversation with Moma, Papa, Mami & Mama on domestic violence, patriarchy & religion
	- Vented out a lot, Mama has inverted face today, but I think I did good, other than the fact that I was very angry
- Consumed: Started ethics class by [[Dr. Vikas]]
- *Did well* - Started on very important conversation
- **Could be better** - Democratic
### Note to next dayâ€™s self
> [!tip] Reminder
> Dear [[Monday]] Nihit,
> Doing this for the first time, so it feels new & I am using the template to do it.
> In the middle of it, had a call with Anne & so now it is technically monday.
> So, I will be concluding this in few words today.
> 
> I did good with the conversation & can clearly improve on my temper & discussion skills but I did good & I am although reluctantly, but proud of myself.
> 
> I should get on with my life from now on & really do some meaningfull stuff
> To put it in even fewer words, I promised Mami that I will do good study work in the next 2 weeks, so get on with that.
> 
> Lovingly, 
> Proud Nihit of The Final Sunday!>
