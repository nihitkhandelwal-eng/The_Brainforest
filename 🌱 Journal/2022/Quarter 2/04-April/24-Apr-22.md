### Day in Review

- Felt: ðŸ¥³ Happy
	- Very long conversation with Moma, Papa, Mami & Mama on domestic violence, patriarchy & religion
	- Vented out a lot, Mama has inverted face today, but I think I did good, other than the fact that I was very angry
- Consumed: Started ethics class by [[Dr. Vikas]]
- *Did well* : Started on very  important conversation
- **Could be better** : Democratic
### Note to next dayâ€™s self
> Dear [[Monday]] Nihit,
> Doing this for the first time
> Acknowledge the weirdness of the first few times (optional).
> List 2 or 3 things I did well today. Own todayâ€™s victories (keep this short).
> Acknowledge where you blew it today. Quickly, efficiently, and without judgment. Own it.
> Write a line or a paragraph that will encourage my tomorrow self (the way I would encourage a close friend)
> 
> A warm salutation,
> Nihit
