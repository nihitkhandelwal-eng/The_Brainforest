### The Green Room
Found the most well maintained & the most sincere snooker club I could have ever imagined, it's called the "The Green Room".

The owner, [[Himanshu Yadav]] is very professional & the players are very good.
Yes, Anne, I am here. This was me responding to anne & angela who mentioned me in great hall. Then I slept, practo guy called me for the sample collection & so, I'm up at 08:36

### Connect 
Overheard Mama saying to Mami, that "Jabse woh sorry bola hai (referrring to the discussion with Me, Moma, Daddy, Mami & Mama), I feel good & better about things."

Also these days, me & Mami do a bit of meal planning every week & Mami said, that this has improved her life & reduced her stress levels considerably.

**So, I am feeling very good about myself this morning.**
