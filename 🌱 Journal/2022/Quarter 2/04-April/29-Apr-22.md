### The DAMS Conundrum
The day was going reasonably well, woke up late though, then went with Mama for fixing the broken mirror thing, it took from 12:00 to 14:45, then Papa called.

I am not trying to villianize him, but we had an argument over the DAMS thing, where he wants me to go to the live classes so as to push me out of my comfort zone.

I am not in the mood to write/type so I'll just stick the conversation here.
