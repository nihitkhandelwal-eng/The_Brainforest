### Morning Pages
I have a therapy session at 11:00, she might be running 10-20 minutes late but that's okay, I took a cup of coffee & I almost wrote "a cuppa coffee", watching a lot of British shows on Netflix.

I wrote 1600 words today & finished my work from the previous session, I am happy & proud of that thing.

Kana Yaari is stuck in my head & so is the Quickstyle Dance Group's Dance Video.

Mama & Mami are having some argument, but not my concern. Yes, we are reframing things these days.

I forgot to take methylcellulose, my eyes are paining, I will take it now. Also, I started taking all my medicines, Tuesday is the new Monday, since Monday is busy dealing with the disappointing start to Monday itself.
