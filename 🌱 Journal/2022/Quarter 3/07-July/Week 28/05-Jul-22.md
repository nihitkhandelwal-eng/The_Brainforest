### Morning Mindset
- Sleep | I slept accidentally while playing chess, forgot to bring Aanya to my room. The thing is that I bring her to my room at 02:00 or whenever I sleep, so that I can work without having to turn the lights off. Me & her sleep on the same mattress, so I have to sometimes sleep on the floor. 
	- I woke up at 06:45 & immediately transferred her to my room.
- Feeling ðŸ¥³ Happy | Gave a bath to Baby Panda
	- I will share the photos later, but it was fun!
- Looking forward for getting back in the workshop
- Might trip me out - Procrastination |  **Deal by**  I won't procrastinate
- I will be gifting the panda quest diary to Om.
- One phrase to rule them all - Intentional
- Eagle's eye view - Get back on track it's high time or else you are nobody
- **Bold Task!** - Finish all my tasks for today
- **Win the day** - If I can finish week one across my vaults for workshop
