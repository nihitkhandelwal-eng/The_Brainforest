### Day In Review
- Not at all good & very similar to the past 3 days. 
- 13:35 → I won't like to wait for the proverbial new day & rather start studying right now.
- Let's think of a "Win the day" task → Study for 4 hours

### Consume
- 13:36 → Watching episode 113 of Tippani, not super good but nice.
### Connect
- 22:25 → Talked to anne about baby panda's new dress & then about me coming to the US & studying in University of Illinois under [Dr Marvin](https://www.psych.uic.edu/profile/robert-w-marvin), who is the director of the residency program.
