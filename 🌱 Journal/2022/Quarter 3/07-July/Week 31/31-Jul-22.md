### The issue with not following through
I genuinely feel bad for making Anne go off of Obsidian, she did say that this made her revisit some of the stuff & learn obsidian from the ground up but I still feel guilty.

But even I feel that I should get back to it, otherwise I just feel that something is missing & I just don't know what.
I am not studying for about 10 days now & this is not good for anyone.
