### Day In Review
Not anything to write about. Concerned about Anne.
- 16:56 → I will be around on gather, since Anne just woke up & she was not doing well yesterday. But after that, I would like to immediately start LYT Workshop.
	- Have not planned one yet, will be talking with Anne for a while & then workshop, so I think win the day could be "Work on the week 1 workshop for 3 hours"

### Connect
- 16:57 → Had a good fraction thing with Vitty.
- Teased Mami about her scolding the kids & her being a topper in school.

#### Anne Planning
- [x] Dishes
- [x] kitchen counters
- [x] Laundry
- [x] Pick up living room → pieces of cardboard
- [x] shower

### Consume
- 16:57 → I don't think atleast by watching "6 Days" that SAS of the British Armed Forces is the best tactical team in the world. I feel that the Navy Seals or Marine Corps from the US are way better & again my experience is coming from groundbreaking work of me watching "Zero Dark Thirty"

### Cerebrate
- 16:59 → Just thinking too much about spy missions
