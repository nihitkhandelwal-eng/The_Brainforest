### Connect
- Sunday Council Meeting #100 #council-meeting
	- We are using the new app called gather town & it looks good. It is basically what zuckerberg want in meta.
	- Conrad asked a new question this time, to celebrate #100
		-  How has joining Co-x3 impacted you?
	- Joshwin went first about how it helped him find his job & then about his week
	- Shania is talking about something which I am not listening to but I like australian accent in general.
	- Anne talked, she was grateful & sad with how things were with Rich & it was emotional, for me as well & then I talked, I donâ€™t want to take notes now, I am overwhelmed (in a positive way)
