### Cerebrate
I am here taking notes on some of the audio‚Äôs that I have recorded
- 2 hour discussion with Papa & Moma on how my issues dates much earlier than the breakup
	- The point they make is by an analogy where, Papa had a broken bone during the accident with esteem car.
		- When the bone did not heal even after 6 months, it was diagnosed that, he had TB in his spine & the accident merely cracked it, the bone was already weak #status/üçÉboat 
	- So, when I have the discussion with [[Dr Aastha Dhingra]] i.e. my psychologist, I should keep this in mind & tell her a complete history rather than just the events after breakup or even Final year exams.
	- Talk to all the tech people I know to learn more about the tech field, Freelancing, Salaries, Job Structure & Job Growth  
	    * Job Qualifications  
	    * Job Growth  
	    * Freelancing  
	    * Salaries  
	    * Learning Curve  
	    * Am I hirable at my current knowledge  
	    * What Should I do to make myself hirable  
	    * Ben & Ashley  
	    * Conrad  
	    * Parshuram  
	    * Siddharth  
	    * Sharad  
	    * Mama  
	    * Mami
* Gamification System For Kids
	- On Make Work Fun
	- Embed For Friends
	- Create one more account for me or someone else for aanya to compete with
	- Notion can have checkbox type property, or number based properties
	- The name for these properties would be customizable & it would be best done by me, so I will get people to fill a form & based on that, I will have a custom gamification template for them
	- The basics will be same for all, like base thing will give this many points, the big tough thing, which may be brocolli for some kid, maybe curd for someone else will give same number of base points, & I can have a +/- multiplier system
	- Another idea was enter the number of chapati‚Äôs for it
	    - So, # of chapati * some number to give points
	- Checkbox behaviour is reinforcable, so make that a priority
	- Difficult is capped at 10, so work with that
	- Create a database linked to this one, this new database will be of vegetables & individual edible components for kids to include in what they ate
	    - These components will have point based on nutrition they give & this can also be customized by parents ^94e773
	    - For eg: for someone like vihaan, weight increasing things can be given importance
	- Essential things can have a checkbox for them, rest can be in relations
	    - For eg: Spinach, or coriander or any other thing is in database but ‚Äúate green vegetables will be a checkbox‚Äù
	    - Frame the question to the parents like, what is the one thing, you definitely want your child to do
	- What else besides food can be used in game ideas?
	- 
	- if kids are younger the parents will enter it but if the kids are 12+ they might delete it, figure out how to solve it
