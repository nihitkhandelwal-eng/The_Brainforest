### Connect
#### Domestic Violence
- Yesterday I had a long talk with Mami about her issues with Mama, she was crying because he yelled at her when he was on a call & she was teaching Aanya, he came out & shouted "Fucking keep quiet"
- So she was crying & then explained that because he is not very happy, he is frustrated & so he takes it out.
- She then told that he used to hit her during the first 9 years of marriage
- She then also said that because her parents raised her well & she has values, she hasn't left him, but girls from today won't tolerate this & how she is not like "aajkal ki ladkiyan"
### Consume
- As a result I am watching Thappad today & crying
- Also listening to call records with her from 11-14th May & I genuinely feel depressed, hopeless, it's like re-living those times.
