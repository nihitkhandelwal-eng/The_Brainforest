## Morning Pages
- It is maybe for the first time in obsidian that morning pages are actual morning pages with the idea schedule, well not ideal.
	- I couldn’t sleep at night so I finished the 500 piece puzzle

	- I then went on a morning workout thing outside, I forgot to take a picture, the weather was really good & It’s not always that I notice such things, so it was really nice with mild dew & fog.
	- Had a nice video chat with Moma & Papa, I then came back to have some lemon water & change shoes, but Mama’s shoes turned out to be very uncomfortable.
	- Anuj J, that’s what I will be calling him, was supposed to come for the run, but he came late, so I joined him again, but I couldn’t even complete 1 round with him.
		- Talked to him about his job, that’s what I mostly do these days.
		- I am writing this from the gallery outside Mama’s room & this reminds me to take a picture
