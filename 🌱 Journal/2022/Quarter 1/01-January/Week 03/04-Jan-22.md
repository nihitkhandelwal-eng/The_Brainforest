- 13:14 → Had a nice discussion with Mama about all the rules of mothers and fathers in a child's development and how they both behave differently as in the perspective from Mama why is that because mothers don't have much control over other aspects, atleast that was the case before, so they tried to have more control over kids to have some sense of value 
	- I although disagree with that but like I need to prepare some arguments as to why are disagree with it and it would be nice to have some sense of continuity in this and then present my arguments to him. #status/action/❓question 
- Trying out automations for shortcuts
	- Changing this from computer
	- Final test run to see commit status
