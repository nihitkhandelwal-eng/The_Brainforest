## Late Night Thoughts
- Cannot sleep, somewhat frustrated.
- Ordered biksu by [[Varun Grover]] for [[üë§ Vihaan]], it was for Rs 540/- 
- I am listening to [[295]] by [[Sidhu Moosewala]] on loop for the past 2 days & easily for the next 30 days as well. 
## Morning Pages
- I slept at 7:00 in the morning & woke up at 12:30, then had Palak Paneer & Dal Tadka for Lunch.
	- There came up an interesting thing, Vihaan has to go the washroom during lunch & this was a habit as told by Mama. 
		- What can be done about that? #action/‚ùìquestion 
- I did 16/8 fasting thing today, happened by chance but I will count it.

## Daily Questions
- I feel very optimistic & hopeful today
- I am very excited about starting Dr Najeeb Lectures
- I would like to be a sincere boy today
- Not doing anything till the end of day might stress me out but that can be said for anyone, so I truly believe that nothing can stress me out today.
- It's not at all a gift but I can help Mami with Dinner to show my appreciation.
- It's a fresh start, I don't have to worry about my past, I don't have an anchor holding me at the dock, I can be anything I want to be.
- Truly speaking, I don't think there is need to do anything bold today.
## Consolidate
### Connect
- Mami is very nice with all the troubles she is going through to accomodate me, well I don't mean trouble but yes inconvenience. I AM NOT CAUSING HER TROUBLE.
- She made, Palak Paneer in the afternoon (the maid made it but it was awesome)
- Dal ka chilla in dinner ^161281
### Consume
- 17:02 ‚Üí Trying to sort for the final time
	- This was me trying out the ipad shortcuts
### Cerebrate 
- While bathing, a thought popped up while I was removing my ‚ÄúKi fark painda hai‚Äù t-shirt given by Mami, I had this conversation with Aanya at Nani‚Äôs house while we were leaving, that she does not like the color black & then I remembered that she wore black yesterday but & this is the good part‚Ä¶
	- Vihaan asked me this question as to the color preference theory in popular culture that, bright colors like red & pink are girl colors & colors like blue & black are for boys.
	- His thoughts were that color is not gender specific & to that mind says [[Baant dia iss dharti ko, kya chaand sitaro ka hoga]]
- While eating ![[#^161281]] Mama talked about Sector 29 in Gurgoan which is a particularly loud place & how he doesn't like that but has to go with [[Kapil Mama]] but at the same time, he also doesn't dislike it. ^k0a897
	- This led me to thinking that [[üü¢ Inbox/Forcing something on someone despite their clear resistance can lead to disliking behaviours]]
