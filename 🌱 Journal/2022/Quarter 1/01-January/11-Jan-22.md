## Morning Pages
- Had a superhero dream, involving Spiderman & Captain marvel, also [[ðŸ‘¤ Ashok Uncle]] helping me sleep.
- I feel very cold today, donâ€™t want to go out for a run, I will instead workout in the home itself.
- Mama is cutting papaya for everyone & Vihaan & Aanya are on class calls ![[image.jpg|+side+pin-med]]
- Mami prepared a tandoori sandwich for everyone but I will wait till noon to complete my 16/8 timing.
- I started studying yesterday or technically today 
	![[10-Jan-22#^078744]]
- I am very excited about completing G.Pharma & taking notes on [[ðŸ“š How to take smart notes]]
- I would like today to be described as a responsible day.
- I donâ€™t think that anything could stress me out, itâ€™s a very stress free environment here, not that it was very stressful back at home.
- I am going to be very mindful in appreciating Papa & the patience he has for me.
- I am 3 years old, I have lots of time, I am reasonably knowledgeable & I donâ€™t have to be so depressed about my life, I have good things going on for me.
	- I am in the best possible phase of my life, I have no responsibility, I donâ€™t want to waste this time & instead I can make use of it.
- If I could finish G.Pharma by 16:00 that would be quite bold
