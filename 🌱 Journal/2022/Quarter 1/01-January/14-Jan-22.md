### Morning Mindset

- **Feeling**...  ðŸ˜« Bad
	- Kamal Khan of NDTV died this morning and I got to know about this just a few minutes ago so itâ€™s definitely very sad

> Excited about I want to finally put down my thoughts about how to take smart notes of introduction and chapter 1 into words

> *One phrase to rule them all* : Resilient

- Might trip me out: I am stressed about Papa and Moma.
I donâ€™t like the fact that Kamal Khan tired of sudden cardiac arrest and it makes me wonder and worried about the state of Covid and my parents
	- Deal by: I will have a brief talk with them in the evening, to reassure myself
- I can show my gratitude to Mama and Mami

> **Eagle's eye view** : Donâ€™t give up hope

> **Boldly Go!** : Finish 50% of how to take smart notes

> *Win the day* : If I can feel better about myself

### Cerebrate
- Brainstorming the timeline for Lynparza project
	- Tried doing it here but shifting to do it in Notion
