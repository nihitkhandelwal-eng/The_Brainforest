## Morning Pages
- It's 12:01 & I am all done with the morning stuff, had a nice sandwich in breakfast, Mami made sandwich with pesto sauce & basil leaves.
	- Mama & I went grocery shopping, he told me about the area & how the social & financial structure is formed here in Gurgaon.
- I am now suddenly excited about the spaced repetition plugin update of which I got a mail yesterday, so going to check that out now!
	- Okay It is not as exciting as I hoped it would be.
