### Afternoon thoughts

- **Feeling**...  ðŸ˜¤ Lazy
	- I'm not sure maybe I slept less the night but I'm feeling very sleepy

#### Checking in for the day
- Day is going **As expected**
	- I am feeling very sleepy right now I just came back from eating at McDonald's and now I would like for some way to remove my sleeping ass and so I would like to maybe drink coffee

### Connect
The neighbour aunty (83) whose husband got his leg fractured, came to Mami to ask for donating blood in the blood bank for the 2 units transfused to him.
I went & everyone here panicked, but it was fun
Also went to a book store called Bahri Sons & took 2 books â†’ [[Dinkar Ki Kavitayen]] & [[Maybe You Should Talk To Someone]]
The books there were very interesting & I would really like to go there again, once I read the great amount of books I already have.

Listening to the introductory course for [[Meditation]] by [[Sam Harris]] on the waking up app, he introduces the term [[ðŸŸ¢ Inbox/Mindfulness]]
