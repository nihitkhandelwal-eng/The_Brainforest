## Reading on CBT & Self Regulation Tracker → by Anne
[[Cognitive Behavioural Therapy]]


### Connect
- 18:03 → I talked to anne about how to regulate therapy time & she advised me to keep an eye on the clock which also helps in planning out the session as well.
- 18:25 → If kids are asking for play time, cross question them with "how much time do you want?"


### Memory Palace Experiment for Cognitive Distortions

I will take my room in E-004 as an example & will start from door to table to AC to washroom to cupboard

1. At the door, either I keep it completely open or completely closed → This is All or Nothing Thinking
2. Then I wanted to turn on the lights but I remember saying foolishly that "I like darkness" → This was overgeneralization, I tend to like dimly lit things at some point & not at some. 
3. At my side table are threptin, I initially didn't like the chocolate flavoured one but the positive side is that I finally explored what I wanted to for years → Thus I improved my mental filter


Okay I feel that this is now pointless, so not doing it anymore
