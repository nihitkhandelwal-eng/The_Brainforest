### Blurb for the letter to Conrad
I was not in the meeting between Conrad, Joshwin & Anne. From what I have heard from Anne & Joshwin, it seems that the issue was about ethics & morals regarding the product hunt comments. I feel that ethics have to be in the forefront when we make decisions, especially decisions that are public.

That not only keeps our conscience clear but also sends a strong message to the community that we are supposed to be leading.
