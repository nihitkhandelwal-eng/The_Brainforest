### UX Session 2 → Research
- Keep user at the center
- Sympathy vs Empathy
	- Sympathy is I know how you feel 
	- Empathy is I feel how you feel
		- Avoiding errors before users can make them is an empathetic element.
- Target Demographics
	1. Age
	2. Location
	3. Occupation
	- Find people & bla bla
		- Try to get people who you don't know.
		- Specify agenda, time & purpose → in general.
	- Find extreme users → the idea being, that they are able to voice out problems faced by most users as they use the product more.
