### The first secret of great design | Tony Fadell
- Example of putting up a sticker on a fruit & then the issue of peeling the label off.
- Initially it was not very pleasant but eventually we get used to it (everyday things)
- Why do we become used to everyday things?
	- We have limited brain power, so our brain encode these everyday things into habits, so we can free up space to learn new things.
	- It's a process called Habituation.
		- It is helpful & makes things easy
		- Example of learning to drive & how nerve wracking it was.
			- Your brain was noticing every small detail.
			- Eventually driving becomes second nature & now you could talk to people while driving, whereas earlier it was very distracting to do so.
	- If we didn't habituate things, we would notice every little detail all the time. It would be exhausting & we'd have no time to learn about new things.
	- But sometimes habituation is not good
		- if it stops us from noticing the problems that are around us & eventually fixing those problems, that's not good.

- Examples of designs
	- Mary Anderson in 1902 designed the first windshield in a car to solve the problem of manually removing the snow from the front of the car, which would make the driver & the passenger uncomfortable.
	- Steve Jobs deciding to make his products ready to use out of the box to solve the "Charge before use problem", which again was not a very happy experience.
