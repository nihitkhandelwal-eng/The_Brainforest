### Mami expressed some of her emotions!
Writing this on 28-Nov-22 | 12:05
Okay, I forgot the whole thing but again, I went to discuss it with vihaan & we pieced it together

Vihaan actually helped me mediate some things b/w me & her.
On the night before his birthday, I was still not at peace with the manipulating tactics between me & her. Vihaan mediated & asked to his mom "why did you do this?". I am sure it was out of love & concern.

This led to me & her talking, I told her how it actually helped me, just that I don't like the tactic.
Things were good, we both expressed & it felt good, I thanked vihaan & slept.

#### After his birthday party
We came home & I settled my Nana Nani, once they were good, I went to Vihaan's room to say goodnight & there, Mami walked to me & hugged!!!!!!

I believe the reason was that she felt relieved & happy for what she did & that it paid off.
I am actually writing this on 29-Nov-22 | 10:34, so I don't remember the as is story. 

- [x] Write down what happened the night before vihaan's b'day (the talk b/w me, Mami & vitty)
