Interesting way of looking for a job that you want by Bhramjeet (UX Designer who came in for a class)
- Identify the domain in which you want your job
- Look for & list out all the job descriptions that that domain has
- In those jobs, then look for skill sets required
- Try to check the list of the skill sets & learn the required skills
