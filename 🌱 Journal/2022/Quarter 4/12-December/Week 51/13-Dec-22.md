### Interesting Insight on Procrastination Alert
- Earlier I used to be a big fan of the alert thing, where it would notify you if you are even a day late & I remember asking Anne to do the same & she said "Nope, I am good"
- I thought that she wants to go easy on herself & I am the one with the audacity to face my shortcomings
- Now I realize that I had a compulsory need to punish myself, which I no longer have, atleast not today. YAYY
	- Anne made me write the Yayy thing. 

I am archiving this so, sharing it here.

*WOW! This is sounding terrible.  Are you getting rest, fluids, you know the drill.  let's see lasting 1-2 days, but up to 14 days?!  Not liking the sound of this.  My cure is the one where you suck on ice chips, and slowly getting back to your normal spicy eating habits.  Medicine and rest.  Ok ... there you go, and we'll slide our bill under the door.  :)  Hope you are getting rest Nihit and feeling better.  Let us know how you are doing.*
