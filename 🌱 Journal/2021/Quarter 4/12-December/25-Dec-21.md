## Afternoon Writing in Gazebo
- The arthur morgan alarm clock lead to a game like dream today, where I had a life & on failing a mission I would repeat the same dream sequence again with a few changes.

- While writing this I took of my sleepers & felt the artificial grass which felt nice so, it naturally poses a question/advice, **maybe I should step out more, not with people but alone**, like Siddhashram.
- Saw a part of the last night’s prime time, which is very good & also very smart, will talk about it under consume but I just wanted to mention it as part of the daily highlight thing.
- Morning Review & End of Day Review are not being done for a long time, I should break them down into multiple tasks & with no subtasks so that I can actually do them & not just cancel them.
- I feel good today, I actually felt very good yesterday but I didn’t do anything with it & as a result today I am only good, so if I don’t want this good phase to be over very soon, I should do something with it today.
