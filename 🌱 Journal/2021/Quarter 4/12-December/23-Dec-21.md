## Afternoon thoughts
- I woke up at 11:30 after Moma tried waking me up for 2 hours.
- The dream was somewhat familiar, it was about some prison & catching bad guys by being Iron Man like, also the bad guys were Brahmin.
- I then took some rice with Aloo-matar from Moma, I heard someone playing something guitar like & it was Nana playing the eukulele. He came by to meet Nannu
	- We had some talks about registry documents & what a "patta is", then some common talk about everyone's health. I usually am not someone who would write this many details but since I am trying to be more intentional with written journaling, I am going to do it.
		- Saraf Nani had aortic stenois & got the valve replaced.
		- Okay I am not going to do it
