## Afternoon Writing
![[CC98D84C-9353-446E-A623-BFC357FD85BD.jpeg|+tape]]
- Sitting in the gazebo garden with Papa & Moma, taking in the sunshine heat. 
- All of my tasks which seemed very important are done, I have done a revamp of the way I use my External Drives.
- I am using an image adjustment snippet to make my writing look nice & I am very much happy about it.
- To top it off, I am writing without [[The Big Bang Theory]] or [[The Office]] in my ears.

## Consolidate
- Almost done with the pending tasks in my head & now will work on the student faction before mirtazepam shows its effect.
- Really glad that I wrote today, *extremely happy!* 
### Connect
- [[ðŸ‘¤ Nannu]] has written a few poems of his own & they are all good but noe of them is just very fascinating & since now I have this big knowledge management thing, I want to store it & cultivate it further. It is called [[â™« Isn't it all what I asked for]]
- He wrote another one recently, I only have a paragraph from it. It is called [[â™« It's not my head anymore]]
- Nannu has a friend, [[Shivansh]] & he writes a lot & is a very sensible person, he wrote a poem for Nannu. I am calling it [[â™« We would have laughed a lot together]]
### Consume
- After a 2-3 week break from qawwali, I am back on it & now listening to [[â™« Aag Daman Mein Lag Jaegi]]
