## Morning Pages
### Sleep & Early Morning
- Had an elaborate dream with sikar school mates & Indrajeet sir,[^1] it is after a long time that the dream was not related to her. I slept while browsing cheap porn on twitter, had my laptop on where I was supposed to start studying & on my ipad was watching Black Widow.
- Moma was watering the plants so I joined, she has to go to a few places today, including Jaipur for a wedding
	- This wedding thing is reallly annoying 
- I ate soyabean with rice & then some imli & now eating oranges
- I finished black widow, which was not a very good movie & now started Dr Strange but will continue it later & currently as of 11:39 , I am Journaling properly after a very long time.

### Thinking about the day
- I am somewhat excited to use RemNote again & solving those flashcards related to hotkeys & some notes in G.Pharma
- I really want to make today count & not just watch movies & eat like I used to do back in Jodhpur, speaking of which [[Chacha]] has my scooty now & we can't find the RC, so I might have to go to Jodhpur to get a copy & that is just wonderful.[^2]


[^1]: Indrajit sir used to be our sanskrit teacher in classes 5th, 6th & 7th
[^2]: Fact: it is not wonderful & I hate it.
