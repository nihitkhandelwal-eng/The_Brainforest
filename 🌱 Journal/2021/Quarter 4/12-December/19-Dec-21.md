## Late night thoughts
- Back from jaipur & watching [[ðŸŽ¬ Spider-Man No Way Home]] which was not as good as I expected it to be & the details of which I will go in later.
- In light of recent conversation with Moma that Papa has been under stress due to me not studying, Moma was somewhat angry as to me trying to convince Papa by a superficial talk routine, which she suggested me to do in the first place.
- Nevertheless, I was talking to Nannu & broke down about the superficiality of things & how I feel very useless in a place where there are people like his batchmate Shivansh, who is going through PTSD as a result of being molested earlier in his childhood, he is struggling through a lot & compared to him, I am like a kid crying about not getting his ice-cream the way he wanted to.
- So, now I am going to put obsidian & my mind to better use & brainstorm something here for a change

- [x] Complete Yesterday's Journal Entry
- [x] Quietly go through all categories in Marvin to brainstorm potential tasks to work on
- [x] Catch up with the yearly review process
- [x] Work on the student faction
- [x] Clear out procrastinated tasks
- [x] Do something about github repos
- [x] Work with time blocks - strictly
- [x] Create a plan to make my room into a bubble essentially
