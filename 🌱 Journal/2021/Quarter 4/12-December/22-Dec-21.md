## Morning Pages
- Slept late, ordered food, lots of it & talked to Ann
	- Had a talk with papa & moma about how to proceed further vis-a-vis career path & studying. 
		- They said that we should identify the fact that you cannot study & so, you should consider other options where not much studying is involved.
		- I somehow bought more time but I don't know what I am going to do.
		- They both are very stressed.
	- Had a long & elaborate dream involving "The attack on new york" in the 2012 Avengers movie, space microbes from [[Serious Men]] that watched yesterday & Nana for some reason making dosa.
- Moma woke me up at 11:30, [[Mera Piya Ghar Aaya]] was playing in the background by [[Fareed Ayaz]] & [[Abu Mohd]] 
	- Had Soyabean & Rajma with rice for breakfast/lunch
## Consolidate
- I don't have the time today to add anything of meaning here but I will make time from now onwards & be intentional about journaling.
	- I have my iPad loaded with the [[Logitech Combo Touch]], so that should not be a problem at all.
