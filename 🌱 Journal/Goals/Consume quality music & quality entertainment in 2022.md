### Check-In’s
- [[10-May-22]] → Sharing with the co-x3
	- The goal here is to consume stuff intentionally, I don't like the overuse of the word "intentional" but this is where I definitely want to do it intentionally.
		- I really think that I have good taste & I already consume very entertaining stuff which at the same time is very informative, I should be intentional about it & even better, write & think about what I consume.
	- Right now I am watching Season 6 of Better Call Saul, there is a lot to learn here about screenplay & the thought process that went behind writing this masterpiece. I am yet to write anything down about it & will do it soon
	- The other thing I am watching is After life
		- I want to write about what I think while watching this on the first go, so this is something that I am very excited about
### Objectives
- To document & thus have a good knowledge on ghazals, qawwali & poetry
- To document my thoughts on some quality entertainment works, like the guy in [[Basement Breakdown]] does
