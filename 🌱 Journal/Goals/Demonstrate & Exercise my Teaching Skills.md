### Check-In’s
- [[10-May-22]] → Appreciating my skills
	- I have started a new thing, where I appreciate some aspects of my life & things where I am good at, I find this an arrogant thing to do, but lately, there have been incidents where I feel, if I don't do this, no one else recognizes my contributions & skills. 
	  I might be wrong, but this is where I am now.
	- I think that I am a good teacher, particularly to kids but to everyone in general.
