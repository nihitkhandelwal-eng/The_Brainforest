### Check-In’s
- [[10-May-22]] → Appreciating my skills
	- I have started a new thing, where I appreciate some aspects of my life & things where I am good at, I find this an arrogant thing to do, but lately, there have been incidents where I feel, if I don't do this, no one else recognizes my contributions & skills. I might be wrong, but this is where I am now.
		- I think that I am a good teacher, particularly to kids but to everyone in general.
	- I will give a few examples, just to make myself feel better here...
		1. I went to my aunt's place on Jan 2nd & it has been 4 months since then, I have quite a few accomplishments to feel good about in the aspect of teaching.
			- Aanya eats vegetables
			- I have reduced the screen time of both the kids 
			- Aanya & Vihaan now takes jokes reasonably wellAanya is super interested in science (I have even created a YouTube channel for that), will be posting some updates about that.
			- Both the kids are getting better at outdoor sports & are very keen on going out
			- I also introduced Vihaan to a better video game so that he can slowly pull away from the more violent ones
			- I am still super fun for the kids, even after this much teaching going on.
		2. Both my parents are now relatively progressive than they were before, I think a good amount of credit goes to me there, this can be said about most people that I talk with.
		3. My brother who in himself is a genius, considers me a major part in his mindset change & has conveyed that multiple times, we in our relation now are stronger than ever & are able to learn from each other's rational & progressive mindset.
		4. There was news about my uncle with whom I live with now, he used to beat my aunt & is still a very angry person, not a good person overall I think.
			- This was a matter of shame for me & my family, most of my time since I came to know about it in february is devoted to solve this issue & to somehow make it up to my aunt.
			- I am a strong believer in the fact that, if you can't call out your family in bigotry, than it doesn't matter what you stand for, it's worthless.
			- Time & again, I have stood up to my family since I was a teen & this was no different, I made sure that this should be a  priority in the family & it's a sorry state that it was not earlier.
			- I think I did a decent job there & will continue to do so.
		5. I am genuinely on a path here where anyone who meets me, will not be talking about the generic issues like weather & traffic but it will be about real issues, like patriarchy, racism & other kinds of crap floating around.
	- This long rant is precisely my motivation to work on my teaching & convincing skills, so that I can fulfil my duty as a decent human being & keep calm in my head that I did so.
	- It's not very certain what I can add here as an actionable item, but it is meant to serve as a placeholder until I figure out something.
		- Actually, the science thing with my baby sister (Aanya) is supposed to be one of the actionable item here
