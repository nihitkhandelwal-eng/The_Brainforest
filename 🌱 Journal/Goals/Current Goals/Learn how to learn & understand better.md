### Check-In’s
- [[10-May-22]] → The thing is out in the open.
	- **I haven't read a book in many years now**
	- I have started about 5-7 books but they all are on hold & I have read not more than 20 pages in each of them
	- "How to take smart notes" is something that I want to complete first & I just don't want to read & highlight, I want to "actively make sense out of it"
	- Review on [[25-May-22]]
### Objectives
- Maybe I can then give a presentation to Mami, Vihaan & Mama about what I learnt here.
