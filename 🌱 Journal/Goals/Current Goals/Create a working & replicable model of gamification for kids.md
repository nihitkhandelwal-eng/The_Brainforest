### Check-Inâ€™s
- [[10-May-22]] â†’ No Progress, just hopes
	- I have made commitments about this to my cousins & me not delivering on them is not a good thing, but atleast I should get started, me writing here is a start
	- I will go back to my aunt's place on around 23rd, will talk to the kids then, but before that, **I need something to show them.**
- [[26-Sep-22]] â†’ Some progress, the worst headache yesterday after skipping sleep for 2 nights
	- Tasks completed: 4
	- Time worked: 8h 45m
	- Overall Habit Grade: D-
		- (I expected a B)
	- Self-Assessment:
		- Confidence: 4/5
		- Motivation: 4/5
		- Overall it's going: 2/5
	- Some questions I asked myself to reflect:
		- What did you learn about?
			- Sleep should be & will be priority 1 from now on.
			- Maintaining a routine is the key for me to start improving.
		- How was therapy?
			- It was a bit harsh but also really helpful in the fact that I recognize the importance of maintaining a routine.
