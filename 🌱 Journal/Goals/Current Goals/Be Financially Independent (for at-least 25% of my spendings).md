### Objectives
- I have a balance of 1,07,803 Rs in my SBI account from my internship
- My objective is to earn 2 more lacs to get it to 3 lacs

### Check-Inâ€™s
- [[10-May-22]] â†’ USMLE costs a lot but gives back more
	- I was of the mood that, if my studies are not going anywhere, might as well apply for a job
		- That is out of the window after the decision to go after USMLE
	- I still want to make some money on the side, so will look at some WFH options & by putting out some of my work on gumroad or patreon.
		- I am really not sure about this, I will talk to Conrad about this (review on [[05-Jun-22]])

### Projects
#### Payment Gateways
- Gumroad â†’ [https://app.gumroad.com/nihitkhandelwal](https://app.gumroad.com/nihitkhandelwal)
- Havenâ€™t signed up for patreon & Buy me a coffee
