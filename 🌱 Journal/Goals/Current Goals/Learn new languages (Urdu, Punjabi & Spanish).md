### Objectives
### Check-Inâ€™s
- [[10-May-22]] â†’ Shared with the co-x3
	- Urdu is the language I want to learn, I consume a lot of poetry, ghazals, shayari & qawwali.
	  Majority of this is in urdu & so that's my reason to want to learn it
	- Punjabi is a language I find very soothing, funny & casual at the same time.
	- Spanish is just a cult thing, maybe because of Narcos, Breaking Bad & now Better Call Saul
	- I will be starting with Urdu
		- I have set a recurring task to browse rekhta (the largest open sourced urdu library) for 10 minutes daily & to translate one piece of music, poetry, ghazal, shayari or qawwali.
		- So this links two of my goals, the other being [[Consume quality music & quality entertainment in 2022]]
