### Check-In’s
- [[10-May-22]]  → Introducing snooker to Co-x3
	- I found a brilliant place for playing it, it's called "The Green Room"
	- It is very professional & the players are all better than me, so that's a bonus.
	- Snooker is the game which I am most passionate about, so time to shine!
	- [x] I ordered a specific set of glasses that I need to play the game, because normal specs are meant for reading which we do nose down, snooker we have to look upwards of nose.
