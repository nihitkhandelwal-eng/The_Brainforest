For lack of a better word, this is where I am going to track my super happy thoughts, while there is [[My Dysfunctional Thought Record]] & I track my negative or not so happy thoughts, then the thoughts that come with it & the outcome or result or the action I took. 
The pattern is mostly a negatvie emotion around a situation & then some negative thoughts around that & then some dysfuctional coping mechanism.

But that is just part of the story, I recall when Amandeep Ma'am said that journaling can worsen me by reinforcing thought errors, that is something I am not able to let go in my head. 

What I can do is that I can use my journal & I do use my journal to reinforce improvements in my thinking, judgement & behavior. 
This page is exactly for that.
