Laptop is not a bad thing, I can & will do great things with it.   **Correction → My automatic thought was I watch too much laptop, I shouldn't watch that much, this is not correct.**       | I realized that I should write this in my DFR & went back on working on the DFR & Routine |
| [[22-Sep-22]]  21:00    | I was talking to Nannu & he asked me "Did you study after we talked?" He was referring to the call I had with him on [[20-Sep-22]], where he motivated & talked me through just studying for 1 hour & I didn't even do that. | Upset (50) Frustrated (60) Panicky (60)      | Main kis muh se isko ye boloon ki main karloonga.

I feel sorry for myself that I put the credibility of all those good learning tools under not a good position. | Started watching YouTube & John Olivier                                                   |
