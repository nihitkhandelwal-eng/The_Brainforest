+ [[21-Feb-22|20-Feb-22]] <br> [[Session 1 → AD]] 
+ Relationship Issues & Hobbies v/s Interests
+ I am currently wondering while sneezing & listening to [[Sadho Dekho Jag Baurana]] & [[Sunta Nahin Dhun Ki Khabar]] that whether to type the timeline or to post a picture of it, I am going with typing.
  I am typing this on [[06-Mar-22]] | 14:52
  Okay, so now I have a folder called therapy & it will have all my sessions in it & this timeline note
  The first session was okay-ish, she was late but it felt nice.

+ [[27-Feb-22]] <br> [[Session 2 → AD]]
+ Discussion On Relationship Issues & I Found Out That I Am Not Assertive
+ I took emotional traits from my parents, vented out a lot, felt good & then got some nice questions to think about 

+ 20 March <br> [[Session 3 → AD]]
+ Career Prospects & Lifestyle Orientation 
+ I did not go for a Sunday & the next one, she skipped it. This was a good session & we had some good conversations about this & that.

+ [[Session 4 → AD]] <br> [[Session 5 → AD]]
+ Too Tired & Annoyed 
+ (Writing this on [[15-Apr-22]])
  I don't want to continue sessions with her, it is so frustrating now!
