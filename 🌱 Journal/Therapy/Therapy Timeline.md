+ [[21-Feb-22|20-Feb-22]] <br> [[Session 1 â†’ AD]] 
+ Relationship Issues & Hobbies v/s Interests
+ I am currently wondering while sneezing & listening to [[Sadho Dekho Jag Baurana]] & [[Sunta Nahin Dhun Ki Khabar]] that whether to type the timeline or to post a picture of it, I am going with typing.
  I am typing this on [[06-Mar-22]] | 14:52
  Okay, so now I have a folder called therapy & it will have all my sessions in it & this timeline note
  The first session was okay-ish, she was late but it felt nice.

+ [[27-Feb-22]] <br> [[Session 2 â†’ AD]]
+ Discussion On Relationship Issues & I Found Out That I Am Not Assertive
+ I took emotional traits from my parents, vented out a lot, felt good & then got some nice questions to think about 

+ 20 March <br> [[Session 3 â†’ AD]]
+ Career Prospects & Lifestyle Orientation 
+ I did not go for a Sunday & the next one, she skipped it. This was a good session & we had some good conversations about this & that.

+ [[Session 4 â†’ AD]] <br> [[Session 5 â†’ AD]]
+ Too Tired & Annoyed 
+ (Writing this on [[15-Apr-22]])
  I don't want to continue sessions with her, it is so frustrating now!
  Punctuality Issues & Lack of communications from her
  
+ 19 August <br> [[Session 6 â†’ SD]]
+ Happitude Studio & Google Calendar Bookings
+ After more than a month of sleep disturbances, [[ðŸ‘¤ Nannu|Bhai]] sent me this link & I was really impressed by the online booking part for some reason... who knows?
  
  I booked my sessions with [[Shristi Dhupar]] the junior most of the lot but I was confident.
  Had a massive vent out in the first session.
  
+ 22nd August <br>  [[Session 7 & 8 â†’ SD]]
+ Booked a 2 hour & Paid Advance for 20 Sessions Package
+ Lots of venting out & sleep exercise.
  
+ [[25-Aug-22]] <br>  [[Session 9 & 10 â†’ SD]]
+ What Impacts My Mood | Ideal Self v/s Real Self
+ Nothing significant but it feels like I am driving the session more than her, which I don't like.
  
+ [[03-Sep-22]] <br> [[Session 11 â†’ SD]]
+ Estabilish Yourself Before Estabilishing Others | Don't Surround Yourself With Misery
+ This was around the time when I was too concerned about [[ðŸ‘¤ Vihaan|Vitty]] & [[ðŸ‘¤ Aanya|Aanya]]
  I was worried about Moma & Daddy being worried about me.
  Also, Rich was gone for a week long fishing trip & at the same time [[Dr Marvin]] was also on a 2 week vacation, so I was basically sleeping in the morning.
  
+ [[13-Sep-22]] <br> [[Session 12 â†’ SD]]
+ I Felt Like I Am Disappointing Everyone
+ About 4 hours before the session, I sat down & [[Session 11 â†’ SD|finished all the work that she gave me]]
  In the session, she was not happy, atleast that's how I saw it.
  
  Also at the same time, I went to see [[Dr Ashish Mittal]] & was about to see [[Amandeep Taunque]] for my sessions as she is a clinical psychologist.
  
+ 18th September <br> [[Session 13 â†’ SD]] 
+ Terminal Session With Shrishti Dhupar  
+ I conveyed all my thoughts & also told her about Amandeep Ma'am. 
  She warned me about not going too fast in sessions
  
  Finances were discussed but I haven't heard back from her, the session was on [[18-Sep-22]] & today is [[22-Sep-22]]
  
+ [[15-Sep-22]] <br> [[Session 1]]
+ Less Venting More Evaluation
+ Starting of my sessions with [[Amandeep Taunque]] Ma'am 
  It was good, felt like seeing a doctor, someone senior.
  
+ [[20-Sep-22]] <br> [[Session 2]]
+ More History, Some Work & Awareness About Not Reinforcing Thought Errors Via Journaling
+ After the history part & basic evaluation was done, we talked about sleep & [[Sleep Hygiene]]
  I was adviced to go out more & also to socialize which I think I am doing. (Not the exercise & going out more part)
  
+ 27-Sep-22 <br> [[Session 3]]
+ [[My Dysfunctional Thought Record|Dysfunctional Thought Record]] & Lot's of Support
+ Went over the main symptoms, which were â†’ sleep, hopelessness / worthlessness, guilt & lack of concentration, focused primarily on guilt. 

+ [[06-Oct-22]] <br> [[Session 4]]
+ Dull Session, Frustrated with Mami & Her Husband's Incident
+ Changes to DTR were recommended, it was an uneventful session.

+ [[13-Oct-22]] <br> [[Session 5]]
+ Validation & Assurance Issues | Diaphragmatic Breathing | Ignorance is the Advice
+ I was told that I have a tendency to seek validation & that it helps my anxiety. Was adviced to do anything which helps to reduce it. 
  It was a hard session & on the rougher side.
  
+ [[20-Oct-22]] <br> [[Session 6]]
