## Mixed bag of questions after a 2 hour rant.
![[Mar-27-Psychology-Session.mp3]]
#### Are past events bothering us? If yes, how?
##### Past events bothering me 
- The breakup obviously bothers me a lot, so anything that happened during those 5 years, not just in the relationship but anything in general, I don’t like recalling things from my college days.
	- Semesters, Postings, Studies, Final Exams etc.
- I am not a big fan of my childhood as well, mostly because I think that I could have been better. I don’t think I am being unrealistic here, I genuinely believe that I should & could have been better.
##### How are they bothering me?
- I have had & I still have nightmares about these things, in a very specific & detailied manner.
- I have restlessness & lot of anxiety whenever a topic comes up related to anything that I mentioned above.
#### How much of knowledge is good & at what level does it bother you?
- I think that there is so much to learn about so, more you can understand & read is better.
	- With this in mind, I am aware of the limitations of reading about something or having knowledge about something & being practical about it, in the real world.
- Knowledge never bothers me, not having knowledge about something bothers me, a lot.
- I have often told my friends & family members that if at all you feel like abusing me, call me irrational or something which attacks my knowledge rather than the usual abuses.
#### Write anything on any topic & read your content in front of the mirror, reading from paper.
- Talk to yourself again facing mirror on the same topic or any other topic without paper
