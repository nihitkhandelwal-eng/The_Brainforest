> [!caution]
> I tried putting it off, actually I did try to put it off for the first 2 days but after that, even when I sat down to think about this, I did not want to write this thing. It is only due to the fact that the session got cancelled, I calmed down & now I am writing it at 13th Sept i.e. on the day of [[Session 12 → SD]] at 07:26

### Things that bother me & reframing those thoughts
A lot of things bother me, so I am naming them but there is a recency bias.

These are the general things which bother me
1. Scientific Irrationality
	- Intensity → usually 8 or 9
		- unusual circumstances
			- If a person from a science background is involved
			- If someone from my family is involved
	- I think it does require attention from anyone, being a student of science & a doctor, it would be a matter of shame if that's not the case.
		- When I encounter something unscientific, I don't feel like turning the other way. It takes a while but I think it is worth it.
		- Although, I no longer get bothered by the scientific irrationality practiced by the general public, by general, I am trying to exclude Scientists, Doctors, Engineers, people from a science background.
			- But, this makes me all the more frustrated at the "not so general people"
		- I do understand the reason behind why this happens, it is out of fear of the unknown, uncertainty of the future, basically the same reason that can be given for the existence of religion.  
		- I can go on for this for hours, so I will stop here, but this is something that bothers me & the fact that it does not bother so many people also bothers me.
2. Social Irrationality ^aef2f4
	- Intensity → usually 7 or 8 these days, it used to be 9 or mostly 10 about 2-3 years ago
		- unusual circumstance 
			- Privilege levels
			- If someone from my family is involved
	- No, I think that I need to reduce my intensity here. 
	- Ideal intensity is a hard thing to come up with but since I think it should be reduced, I would go with → 4 or 5
		- This is till the time that I make something out of myself & then I will rethink my stand on this, actually the stand remains the same, I am trying to temporarily reduce my reaction to it.
	- Reframing → There are multitude of reasons due to which this issue is so big, they are very diverse & require a more deeper solution, the time & mental space for which, I should not afford. 
		- When I will be in a stable position professionally, psychologically & financially. I will do what I feel like & won't be a bystander.
3. Ignorance
	- I will write something that I said to my parents 2 days ago. 
	- Students/Kids who are good, sincere, curious, in early years are punished for being that way when they become adults
		- Everyone wants their kid to do good in exams, particularly in science & math, the excess of which fuels [[#^aef2f4|social irrationality]] but that's another topic.
		- To not get into peer pressure
		- To ask questions
		- The most common solution I have heard to my "problems" is that → Don't think
			- It most commonly comes with the suffix "...too much" but how do you define that?
			- I have heard the same thing for when I talk about anything to everything, ranging from `which music I listen` to `why do people behave this way` 
		- It is as if it is being encouraged not to be a curious, sincere student.

> [!note]
> I interpreted the question in a way, which suited my subconscious i.e. the topics I have mentioned such as → Irrationality, Ignorance are something that every cell in my body is aware of, I am not at all uncomfortable answering these questions, but finally sense prevailed I have answered it in a way it was designed to be. Time right now is 08:38



| Things that bother me                    | intensity (0-10) | Does this require this much attention from me, if no, what should be the ideal intensity                                                      | How can you reframe that thought                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Kids not talking to me / behavior issues | 6                | No, I am bothered by it, way more than I should. I get hurt by what they say or do. → 1                                                       | I am doing a very good job as a big sibling, worrying about this will never solve this thing, kids before the age of 16, I need to be mature about this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Dad being disappointed in me             | 10               | I don't know what do say here, moma said that it's not all due to me, he is generally negative about things since the time she knows him. → 4 | There are a lot of "although" coming to me right now but for once, I am not going to a hypercounter drive & I will say that, for me to do good & better, I need to be in an environment which encourages me, not that he discourages me, but the way he says it, it does not help. I am not the reason, I may be a trigger & in order for me to improve, I need to let go of this thought |
| Mama's behavior                          | 8                | Things are beyond me now, so I should be smart about this & not let it trouble me so much → 3                                                 | He is someone who I do not respect anymore, I have a bit of contempt towards him, my concern is only to the point that my mom is attached to him but apart from that, I don't expect anything out of him, I am disappointed to the core,  I should try to be less reactive to his behaviors.                                                                                              |
| Mami's Inaction                          | 10               | I have done what I could have & beyond, but it is not my call, ideally, she should separate, but that's her call. → 7                         | Again, I have tried conveying what I feel, my interest is only in the well being of Mami & the kids, I will have to manage with what they choose for themselves. Regardless, I love them very much & that's where my concern start & end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |


- [x] Reframe the sleep issue that happened with mom
	- This is now old in my memory & also I don't want to revisit it


### Write & reframe the thoughts about you perceive yourself & how would you say it out to others
- I think that I am a very reasonable, rational person.
- Now, that it too simple, so.....
	- Politically, I am a socialist, inclining to left of center & not a very pragmatic person.
	- Scientifically, I try to be scientific, I am very open to criticism, a good criticism against me, gives me a great deal of satisfaction. I go out of my way to seek it sometimes. Gives me a sense of security & trust. 
		- I am a rationalist, very passionate about science & the universe in general.
	- Generally, I am an honest person, very transparent.
	- I believe that these are very non-specific traits & I expect others to be on these lines as well[^1]

-  So these were the basics about me, nothing to write home about & now I want to give a bit more background, because these traits are a direct function of my background
	- I am a North Indian, Male, alleged hindu by name, living in North India, where all these are positions of power
	- Both my parents are doctors, very laborious. So I am not in any immediate financial trouble or stress.

 - This is who I am, but there are things which I will mention to people depending on the conversation we are having, the idea is to point out all my flaws, privileges before they do. There are a couple of reasons for that
	 - I am smart & I like to practice that
	 - I don't want people to lie to me, because of any of the things I have mentioned above.
		 - For example:
			 - The hospital staff might butter me up because I am their potential employer.
			 - My relatives might butter me / lie to me because both my parents are highly respected in their side of the families.
			 - I don't like people lying/buttering me, hence I lead by picking on myself, so that they feel comfortable doing so.
	 - I don't like a lot of things, here is a list concentrating on social interactions
		1. I don't like it when people lie to me.
		2. I don't like when people jerk me around.
		3. I don't like when people hold me at arm's distance.
		4. I don't like it when people offer me false solutions without directing things to me.
		- It makes me feel less smart, like they genuinely believe that I am not aware about myself
			- I also have a problem with people who are not self aware & I am aware that I am not completely self aware, there is no such thing but it just feels like an attack on intelligence.



[^1]: I am aware that this thing can be considered as a distortion & it might be. The rationale I have is that, these are very non-specific traits. For example: not being progressive is just being stupid, it's a shame that I have to add these adjectives to describe myself. What other way would you want to be?
