## Life Choices & Work 
![[Session 2 - Part 2 - Feb 27, 15-21.mp3]]
- Instructions given by Dr Aastha 
	1. Keep thinking about these questions all day.
	2. Visualize everything.


#### What does your ideal ‘you’ look like?

- I got the meaning of this question wrong [^1]
- I would divide this answer in some major domains

###### Knowledge 
- I would be extremely knowledgeable in many subjects, particularly 
	- Radiology.
	- Science, this includes physics, chemistry & biology in general. 
	- Psychology to a very deep level. 
	- Coding (almost all languages) → I will be knowledgeable enough to be employed based on that knowledge. 
	- Somewhat in mathematics as well.
	- Social Issues such as patriarchy, casteism & religion as well.
- I would have a very large knowledge base of this knowledge, most likely in Obsidian. 
- I will be knowledgeable enough to contribute to meaningful conversations. 
- I will be someone who can very deservedly be called an intellectual & knowledgeable. 
###### Health & Fitness
- I would be a fit person both mentally & physically. 
- Physically speaking, I would have good muscle mass & a very good stamina:
	- Biceps of at-least 16 inch.
	- Abs & Flexible body overall.
- Mental health wise, It would be an ongoing process, but I will not be ignorant about this by any standards at all.
###### Professionally
- I would have cracked NEET-PG with a rank in top 1000, will do radiology very sincerely from a decent institute.
- Also part time job as a software developer 
- Along with this, a teacher, in any form
	- maybe to kids
	- maybe on YouTube about the topics I have deep knowledge & interests in.
###### Family Wise
- I would have even stronger bond with the four of us than it is now.
- I would have made my Mom & Dad proud, professionally
- I would be someone, who my family looks up-to.
- I would have found a partner who I love & vice versa, I wish I could get over her & move on to think about this, but at the moment, it seems like something I am forcing myself to think, it is not coming naturally.
- I would have a nice friends circle
###### Hobbies & Interests Wise
- I would have all the gadgets I can think of & I will be in a tech heaven of sorts
- I would be a very very good snooker player 
- A reasonably good table tennis player 
- A decent photographer

#### What are your dreams & goals, why are they your dreams & goals & what is keeping you stuck with those?
- The things I mentioned about my ideal self are my dreams & goals 
- I don’t understand the meaning of “stuck with them”, but these are the things that I enjoy &/ or want to enjoy 
- About the science thing, I have a great passion for science & rationality in general, so anything associated with that seems very good to me, it makes me feel good.
- Apart from the science thing, these are all the areas, I have active curiosity about, not to be mistaken that, I don’t have curiosity in science, but because of my big attraction to anything which has science written over it, I feel that I might be interested in some scientific topics where I don’t have an active interest but want to develop one.
#### How much time do you dedicate approximately no working towards your goals?
- I used to schedule a certain amount of time towards each goal I had before the NEET PG thing started hanging over my head
- After Internship, I know what I want to do but that’s mostly conflicting with what I should do & I end up doing nothing.
- Show Marvin to Ma’am
#### What qualities do you most admire in yourself?
%% Jo Nihit manta hai %%

I won’t be pre-fixing my statement with “I think”, because that is understood within the question or should I say pre-understood

One more thing, I don’t appreciate or admire myself in being progressive, I think that’s normal & not being progressive is wrong, just like we don’t appreciate ourselves to drive by the traffic rules & we think that not following them is an issue.

- I am a very genuine person & honest
- I am a progressive person 
- I have a deep passion for science & rationality 
- When I dive in something, I go really deep into the subject matter.
- I am a rational being 
- I am not materialistic or superficial 
- I have & I do stand for what is correct or at-least what I believe is correct 
	- I don’t hesitate to call out bigotry even if it is in my family or a very close person 
- I put my arguments very strongly & I avoid talking when I don’t have knowledge about the topic at hand
#### Do you make decisions logically or intuitively or emotionally? Cite Examples (atleast 3 in details)
%% Give marks to yourself for all i.e. logically, intuitively & emotionally & then come to the conclusion. %% 

- I think I make decisions logically & intuitively 
	- I want to make decisions logically more but, sometimes, logic says that I am not going to do good & so, maybe I go with intuition in those situations

#### How, where & from whom did you learn about sexuality?
- Think about:
	- Gender 
	- Sex
	- Sexuality 
	- Intimate Relationships 
	- How to talk to girls (ladki patate kaise hai)
	- Eve teasing kya hoti hai?
	- Ye sab kahan aur kisse seekha.

###### Gender & Sexuality 
- I don’t recall learning about this from anyone, I mostly educated myself via internet when I came to college.
- I was first told about menstruation in the most disgusting way I can think of by my senior when I was in Hostel, in Jaipur.
	- I was introduced to the details of it, the routine issues with it (not the scientific part) by my partner in college.

###### Sex & Intimate Relationships 
- My first introduction to sex was in grade VI, in an art class where my classmates, explained it to me. They also taught me some abuses & their meaning, it went over my head then & it still goes over my head, the thing is now I know that It is not going over my head, the thing is senseless.
- Then it was through porn & item songs
- I don’t recall any sex education thing happening in my school & I don’t recall any conversations with my parents as well. I have expressed this disappointment to them many times in the past few years.


###### How to talk to girls? 
- I was a very shy kid, so had problems talking to anyone in general 
- School 
	- I got into my first relationship in grade VII, where I never talked directly with the girl, instead exchanged letters through a common guitar teacher.
		- Those were from the internet directly & it was & is a very embarrassing story.
	- I went to hostel in grade VIII & that’s where I was relatively popular with girls who wanted to talk to a decent guy, those girls with “bad guys are charming” thing, never talked to me throughout the year, they only talked to me at the end of that class because by then I realized after my breakup with the first girl that girls like “bad boys”, so I try becoming bad for a while.
	- I came back to my hometown & I again was popular there in my class because I played guitar & girls found me cute, which is when I started hating the word cute, because I thought that, good guys are called cute, it’s a term used just before pulling your cheeks & that’s it. 
		- So, even though I was a shy kid, I felt that I was valued & hence talked with people.
	- I got into 2 accidents 
	- trying to be the bad guy & I didn’t learn even then.
		- That’s when I started messaging girls from my school with messages like “You grew up hot”
- Kota
	- I was in kota for grade XI & XII, I had no interaction with any girl for 1 year there, but I got addicted & hooked to porn there, I didn’t have a good phone, so I used to go to the nearby store & ask for movies (legit hollywood movies with nudity in them) & eventually the guy started selling porn & I took it.
	- In my 2nd year of kota, my father’s friend’s daughter was introduced as my batchmate & in the name of discussing doubts, we used to talk for hours, but not in an intimate way, she laughed at almost anything I said & I love telling a good story with good punchlines, so after kota ended, I got several calls from her with the intention of getting into a relationship or maybe a more intimate friendship 
- College 
	- I was told at the time of my admission by my mother that she has a friend from her college days & her daughter is also getting admission in the same medical college.
	- I was a decent guy in college but I can clearly see the changes in my behavior at that time were inspired from the idea that girls like bad boys & boys who are very confident, talks first & all that stuff.
	- I started talking with everyone around me, because that’s what I thought you are supposed to do & 3 girls got this idea that I was into them because I was talking with them, I had no such intention, nor was I being intimate by any chance.
	- Finally I started talking to the girl who became my girlfriend & she later told me that she had this impression that I was into someone else, i.e. her room partner who told her that I was into her.
		- But after about 2 months, she asked me whether or not I like her?, I replied back with, “do you like me?”
			- she then said yes & so did I 
	- After we got together, I slowly stopped talking to so many people & eventually she & akshat were the only 2 people I talked most with 

###### What is eve teasing?
-  I don’t get why this is a question but I never did any such thing,
- I got to know about it in school, but I didn’t like this, so I didn’t hang out with those people much
- Then in kota, there was an area where all the boys would go to see “hariyali”, these were jokes made by our teachers but as I said, I never participated in any such activity.
- Then never in college with
