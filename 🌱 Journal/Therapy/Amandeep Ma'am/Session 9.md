![[Session 9 Prescription.jpg]]

- Package of 5 session was finished with this session. 
- I chose to pursue USMLE thing again & so I talked to bhai about it later. He agreed. We sketched out a rough plan to begin with.
- But I then got sick on Tuesday & Wednesday, so that's out the window, focusing again on only the UX work.
- I was adviced to continue with DTR & breathing exercises. I am following up on both of that.
