I was recommended to see a clinical psychologist i.e [[Amandeep Taunque]] by Dr Ashish Mittal to whom I went for a psychiatric consultation.

As of [[22-Sep-22]] I have had 2 sessions with Ma'am.
My next appointment is on [[27-Sep-22]] 

I was given some work to do on my last appointment which was on [[20-Sep-22]] & I have not started on that yet.
I am aware that I am not doing very good with that, but I couldn't help my resistance & I am not happy with it obviously, neverthelss I am starting now & silly it may seem, but I am having a hard time doing it.

The first session was around the question, "Tell me about the time where everything seemed normal."

This took me back to beginning of 12th grade
