![[Session 1 â†’ AT.jpg|700]]

I was recommended to see a clinical psychologist i.e [[Amandeep Taunque]] by Dr Ashish Mittal to whom I went for a psychiatric consultation.

She was late by about 15 minutes, this I feel is not that big of a deal but it is in my head since my sessions with [[Aastha Dhingra]]
The first session was around the question, "Tell me about the time where everything seemed normal."

- This took me back to beginning of 12th grade & to the time where I first became restless about the fact that Deepak can score better without studying as much as I do.
- The first session was all about being evaluated with history taking.
- I immediately compared this session with the sessions I had with [[Shristi Dhupar]] of Happitude Studio & I no longer felt that I spoke too much, since I was being interrupted to direct my answers to a more psychological narrative.
- There was no work given in this session
- I felt that she was a bit sarcastic at times, which I love absolutely anywhere else but did not like it much when she did that, we'll see how that goes.
