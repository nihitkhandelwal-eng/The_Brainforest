![[Session 20 Amandeep Ma'am.jpg]]

- I went into the session with almost a disappointment 
- Update routine to include more studies.

- I went into the session with resentment about her idea of me not thinking & writing.
- The conclusion was do whatever you feel like provided you are functional & not stressed out.
- The next week is Diwali, i.e. Mami & Family will be going to Sikar & then to US.
- Next appointment is scheduled to be on [[01-Nov-22]] at 17:00
