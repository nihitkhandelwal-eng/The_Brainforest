I talked to the people in Co-x3 about the Mama incident & it helped.
This thing was troubling me a lot, I talked to Amandeep Ma'am about it but she told me that it is not my issue & I should not be concerned about that.

Nevertheless, it was still troubling me & I was not very much talking to my aunt for 2 days, every time I tried talking, the image of him bringing `paan` came to my head. 

I talked to Anne about it 2 days before the council meeting & she said that "You should be available to her, if she needs you."
In the council meeting, this was repeated & I got a validation kind of thing that I did my part & it's okay to let that go now.
