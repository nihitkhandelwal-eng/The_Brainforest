![[Sessions 1 & 2 → Amandeep Taunque.jpg|700]]



As of [[22-Sep-22]] I have had 2 sessions with Ma'am.
My next appointment is on [[27-Sep-22]] 

I was given some work to do on my last appointment which was on [[20-Sep-22]] & I have not started on that yet.
I am aware that I am not doing very good with that, but I couldn't help my resistance & I am not happy with it obviously, neverthelss I am starting now & silly it may seem, but I am having a hard time doing it.

- While working on this, I got a call from Moma & it was perfect for my DFR ↓

### About the session
- She was 30 minutes late this time, I do realize that I am not someone whose identity is about being punctual but I think I take the word `appointment` more seriously than others
- We continued about the history part & she was evaluating me for [[Borderline Personality Disorder]]
	- "There are traits which can be explained by that" she said. I was smiling at that point, it was the smile of getting momentarily relived of the stuff that has happened over the past 5 years
- This was intensive history, since it involved me recalling 3rd & Final year of MBBS
- While writing this, I am now suddenly aware of why she feels that I should not be journaling. I was just reinforcing those negative thoughts again.
- In the next section I will list all the work that she gave me, which will bring up the workshop as well.


### Work from the session
- I am not allowed to take photographs of what she writes, so from now on, I will either remember what she says or take my own notes & as a result, I will be deleting the image that I took.
- DTR i.e. [[Dysfuctional Thought Record]]
- Sleep is associated with mood regulation so continue to follow [[Sleep hygiene]]
	- For me the wake up time for now would be 06:30 to 07:00![[Sleep Hygiene#^bdd7b9]]![[Sleep Hygiene#^b46555]]
- Start exercise twice in a day
	- Start with morning & evening walk (30 minutes each)![[Sleep Hygiene#^f0fbe5]]
- Prepare Routine
- Social Activation → Before the next appointment meet other people 3 times
