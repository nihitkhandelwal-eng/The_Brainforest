- Started sessions with Happitude Studio with Shrishti Dhupar
- The sessions are online, so I will be recording it from the next time. Also need to reformat this note.



### Medication & Therapy Timeline
- All medications as per recommendation of Psychiatrist
- Started Escitalopram 10 mg OD on May 2021
- Increased the dose to 20 mg OD from July 2021 & it is going on as 20 mg OD as of August 2022
- Mirtazapine was recommended at a dose of 7.5 mg to address sleep issues but it was not followed by me d/t excessive daytime sedation.
- Took Mirtazapine in February for 1 month when nightmares were being excessive.
- I slept for 2 weeks but during the 3rd week, I started feeling better & tolerance to sedation started developing 
- Started therapy meanwhile starting from 21st February 
- Stopped Mirtazapine around late March
- Had 5 sessions of therapy then had to stop it since my therapist was not regular at all.
- Nexito was ongoing as expected but became non-compliant for 3-5 weeks from mid July - mid August.
- Nightmares resumed & started therapy again from 19th August 


### Changes that I have been experiencing in the past 1 month
I will break it down by the severity of what I found to be most relevant

- I feel depressed & disappointed (in myself)
	- I am generally not happy with what I am doing, you'd think that would make me motivated to actually do something, yet I am not doing anything great.
	- But lately, it's not that I am not happy, I feel disappointed & depressed 
- Sleep
	- All the following sleep symptoms have been with me from 2020 to 2022 (February), severity in 2021 post May was the highest but it stopped at around February. 
	- Difficulty in onset of sleep
	- Reversal of sleep cycle in a progressive manner 
	- Nightmares → involving my ex-girlfriend primarily & then about me being a disappointment in general
		- These nightmares were not so much in pattern as compared to what I experienced after the breakup i.e. in March 2021 but some pattern/continuity was there.
	- Inability to wake up even with loud sounds.
	- 
	- Fluctuating hours of sleep → somedays I might sleep for 11 hours, someday 4 hours.
- Studies
	- Sudden drop in motivation / will to succeed
		- This is not a new thing to me, it's the primary reason for which I should have taken therapy for.
		- I was very motivated, interested, enthusiastic & focused about my studies in later half of  May, June & first half of July.
		- That suddenly dropped as if I don’t even care anymore.
		- I know I should be doing something, I even want to do it this time but it is incredibly hard for me to even start doing it.
	-  Inability to concentrate for more than half an hour
	- Easily distracted almost as if I don't want to study
- Inability to sit idle
	- This has been going on since 2019 but fluctuates in intensity
	- I get restless when I am sitting alone & not listening/watching anything
	- It may have something to do with increased access to internet & entertainment via OTT platforms & maybe it is not at all specific to me or to depression
	- I have a hard time sitting at my chair without some music/video/movie/show playing on my iPad
	- This has increased in the past 3 weeks
- Appetite
	- Impulsive eating
		- I tend to eat non-stop when anxious 
	- Loss of appetite for the past 3 weeks
		- I don't feel like eating
		- I am 96 Kgs, so I feel good when finally I don’t have the urge to eat all day.
- Loss of patience
	- Not so patient with my cousins (6 & 11 yr)
