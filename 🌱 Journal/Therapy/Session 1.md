## Therapy Work
### Activity Scheduling
1. List out all the activities that you do in a day, particularly any physical activity
	- I made this based on that day as mentioned [[21-Feb-22#^qus2g2|here]]
2. [[21-Feb-22#^kfdk0v|Next activity was interesting & I spent the next few days on this.]]
	- [[Differences Between Hobbies and Interests]]
	- [[How Interests & Hobbies Are Interrelated]]
	- [[Hobby]]
	- [[Interests]]
	- [[My Hobbies]]
	- [[My Interests]]
3. She told me to do Bhastrika Pranayam first thing in the morning.
	- I asked her the logic behind it & she said, that it improves breathing & is somewhat of an energetic movement 
	- Also read a NCBI article → [Changes in Lung Function Measures Following _Bhastrika Pranayama_ (Bellows Breath) and Running in Healthy Individuals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6746052/) 
	- She told me to do total of 30 with a strategy of 10-10-10

### Activity Grading 
- I was told in the previous session to grade all my activities from 0-5 in terms of fun & satisfaction.
- I have a template for it now & will include the same as a subtask in Marvin

### Self Awareness 
##### How would you describe the relationship Between Your Parents?
- How they are as individuals?
	- My mother is very strong when seen from outside, she is bold in the way she talks, she has many interests-hobbies.   
	- My dad is a very calm, simple, peace loving & he mostly does what the situation demands him to do.
	- They both love their work & are mostly in sync when it comes to work.
	- My dad either has very less to almost no personal interests or he tells us that, so he enjoys whatever my mom does & this is where I feel that their relationship is lob-sided. (according to me).
- They have a good relationship, it’s very together like, they don’t usually do activities on their own, mostly together.
- They are either in sync on most things, if they are not, they don’t talk about it much.
- They care about each other a lot.
##### What did you learn about romantic relationships in your home growing up?
- This is a very non-specific question so I'll answer it in the last
- We live in a small/nuclear family, I have seen my Chacha-Chachi living nearby & my Nana-Nani. My parents are both eldest in their respective families & I am eldest in mine, so I had no Bhaiya-Bhabhi or Didi-Jijaji growing up.
- As far as my parents are concerned... I think they have a very simple relationship, both of them understand each other well, my father has his strengths & my mother has her own.
	- They treat each other as equals according to what they consider equality is but are almost equally ignorant about it, so it works.
- My dad does things for my mother which she likes more & because he does not have many hobbies/interests she balances it in the household & social life.
##### How did adults in your home express disappointments & Frustrations?
- My parents used to make us sit & then discuss the matter in hand, very rarely shouting.[^1]
- I have not seen my father cry much, the few times I remember is during the last 1 year when my grandmother was diagnosed with Gall Bladder Cancer & during the time when I was going.
- Both my parents when in extreme anger tend to pretend to throw something & that’s it.
- My dad is usually very calm, so his idea of expressing frustrations (related to us) is sit down & talk about it. (That also is very rare)
	- He would convey this to my mother & she would then talk about it with me, at least this is the case in the past few years, I don’t recall much from earlier.
	- He almost never expresses his personal frustrations
##### How did the adults in your home repair after conflict?
- They mostly just said sorry & talk among themselves, nothing in front of us.
- But when I was in my teens, I had many disagreements on variety of topics with my parents & my solution was to talk through it over long discussions but there idea was not so much around discussions, but more towards, just let go of it.
- Most of the time where I was denied a lengthy or even somewhat detailed conversation is around studies, my parents used to tell me that first finish your 11th, 12th & then we will have the time to talk about these things that you are talking about.
	- To be fair to them, they did started talking & having more conversations when I went to college but I have always felt that it was not enough.
- This was also the case in my relationship, even after some random breakup we wouldn’t talk about it much because
	1. It induces anxiety
	2. She needs to study
- Even after March last year, which was the most bizarre incident, I can think of, after the cold way in which it happened, I was not expected to talk about it because she feels guilty & because NEET-PG clear karni hai.
##### What did you learn about how to give an apology?
- Generally we used to say sorry & tell what we are sorry for & occasionally we would  say that we won't be repeating it again.
- My dad used to call my mom by her nicknames & then they would hug.
- Up until the last few years, I have no memories of them fighting, if they did, I have seen my dad apologize.[^3]
##### What did you learn about how to forgive someone who has hurt you?
###### Early Childhood (0-8) 
- Moma went to mumbai at around 5 years of age & came back at around 7
	- I don't specifically remember this time but my chachi tells me about my childhood & that's how I know that I used to someone who is very ziddi
	- I used to be a very rigid & angry kid while I was growing up (specifically up to the age around 8), my mother was in Mumbai at that time completing her post graduate studies & I just recall everyone saying in the family to one another that once she comes, he will behave properly.[^2]
	- I used to be a very cry baby & would blame others (ziddi batate hai sab mera bachpan).
	- Aisa attitude tha ki main kyun aage hoge baat karoon
###### Late Childhood (8 & above)
- Being the elder brother, I was mostly told to learn how to forgive someone (in most cases my brother).
###### Relationships
- I don't specifically recall any stories around forgiveness, I don't recall much stories about my parents fighting up until I was in college.
	- But if they did around us, it was my dad saying sorry & that was it, I don't recall much pampering & even if there was, it was not in front of me.

[^1]: I am having a hard time recalling any incidents regarding disappointments & frustrations, it was not like everything was hunky-dory but I really cannot recall much from this.
[^2]: I don't recall much from this time as well but it is mostly as told by my chachi
[^3]: I think that is because my dad does not like to put his point of view very strongly in order to maintain peace, he does that with everyone & for the last few years, me & my brother are pestering him to put his point of view, even if it means that it will lead to a discussion & it will supposedly "disrupt peace"
