## Discussion about the questions from previous sessions 
![[Session 2 - Part 1 - Feb 27 14-49.mp3]]

- I am told that I am not assertive & I had a nice revelation about it. 
- The appointment was for 13:00 & she came at 13:45 & there was someone else before me, so my turn came at 14:30, we eventually did a session of about 90 minutes but I was now determined to convey this to her but ended up saying…
	> I want to increase the speed of therapy & can we have more sessions or sessions in between Sunday’s.
- When she told that I was not assertive, I asked why does she think so, before she could speak, I asked about how I talked to her about she being late to the session & that’s when I came to the realization that I actually said “I want speedy recovery”.
