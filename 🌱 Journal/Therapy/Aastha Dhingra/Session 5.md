%%Paste image here%%

#### You & your close people
- Family
	- Mumma
	- Nannu
	- Papa
	- Aanya
	- Mami
	- Chachi
	- Nani
	- Amma
	- Nana
	- Chacha
	- Mama
- Friends
	- Jain
	- Shashank Bhaiya
	- Annemarie
	- Jacky
##### Why are you close to them?
- Apart from the obvious reasons that they are family or I am associated with them for a long time, hence I am close to them.
- Sense of humour is one of the most significant commonality I can find, I think people who can laugh at themselves & have a sense of humour is a quality I find attractive.
- Progressive thoughts is the other thing, I don’t think people should compromize on that.
##### What keeps you close to them?
- Most of them are open to conversations, I am not close to people with whom I am not having active conversations with.
- Most of them care about me someway or other.
- I am helpful to them & I am a good listener at-least as far as people close to me are concerned.
- I get close to almost everyone I am living with;
	- This may seem like an odd point to say but I have some examples to supplement this claim.
	- Prem & Shivam in Jodhpur, Kunal, Ayush & Chirag in Kota, anyone I meet in Gurgaon.
	- **So, maybe location & being physically close to someone is what keeps me close, but that can be said for anyone.**
	- Now that I think of it, I am basically boasting about how good a person I am. So, never mind! 
#### People away from you
- Jain is both close & away from me right now, but that is mostly because of me evading conversation about my career with him & him joining his PG work
- She is away from me, I don’t know why.
##### What keeps you far?
- One of the major reasons is my incapabities, I am far from jain because I am not able to bear talks about studies & PG work in general, it reminds me of who I am not & who I can’t be.
- Now I’ll be enumerating the reasons she gave me & these are a lot, for a long period after that, I genuinely thought that this was the case with everyone who is far from me, but I was told time & again that it is not the case, now that I am wriitng about it, I feel that, I just forgot about this thought but now it is bothering me again.
	- I talk too much
	- I don’t let go of things
	- I live in a fantasy world
	- I am not ambitious
	- Not so confident
	- My interests & choices are not very good or they are boring
	- Also, I am boring
	- I don’t have self-respect
	- I live in the future
##### How can you keep these people close to you?
- I know that of the things I mentioned above, there are some which I can genuinely work on.
