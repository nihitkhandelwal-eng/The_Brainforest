- What does this remind me of?
	- Democracy
	- Idealism
	- Privilege
	- Critical Thinking
	- Double Standards
- What is this similar to, and different from?
	- Similar to Privilege, because the ability to revolt at home comes with privilege, different because most privileged adults don't come anywhere close the word revolt.
	- Similar to Democracy, because if you are critical of others, you should be critical of your loved ones for the same thing, as everyone is equal, different because democracy won't save revolutions but revolutions might just save democracies 
- When have I experienced this thing in my life?
	- My earliest memory is when I revolted against religion at home
	- I have done it countless times ever since, I did it for patriarchy, brahminical patriarchy, rise of the right wing.
