- A grid is a structure comprising of a series of lines (vertical or intersecting) that divides a page into columns or modules.
- It can be thought of as a skeleton on which a designer can organize the graphic elements

1. Creates clarity and consistency in the layout of the pages
2. Quickens the design process
3. Makes the design easier to modify and reuse
4. Facilitates collaboration

#### Gutters
The space between two columns or rose is called a gutter. This space varies as per design requirement
### Grid Guidelines
Mostly on mobile of 360dp, layout grid uses a 4-column grid, 16dp gutters, 16dp margins & 70dp column width.

> [!tip] 
> **Don't be afraid to step outside the grid** 
> Designers often intentionally break grid columns in order to increase visual interest or emphasize certain elements.
> 
> The grid system is an aid, not a guarantee. It permits a number of possible uses & a designer would go about choosing based on user goals.

### Material Design Language System
The design language system is the *set of UI guidelines* followed by designers, which helps users build familiarity with various apps they will be using in Android ecosystem.

It is a *collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards*, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

- Material design is inspired by the physical world and its textures, including how they reflect light and cast shadows.
- Material surfaces reimagine the mediums of paper and ink.
