- It is a simple coding language used to display information
- It structures the content of a webpage in a bunch of boxes, in most web pages, there are boxes inside the boxes, inside the boxes, the box that contains all the boxes is our browser window.
	- Inside each box there can either be more boxes, text, a combination of boxes, and text, or nothing at all.
	- Based on the name of the box, the browser will display it and its contents differently to other types of boxes, there are boxes for lists, paragraphs, headings, footings, images, links, and plenty more
	-  By default, most boxes are as high as their content, and as wide as the box there inside of
	- Most boxes that as far to the left and as far to the top as they can

### HTML Element
- How do we code an HTML box? 
	- Well, *most HTML boxes have an opening tag and a closing tag.*

	- An opening tag is comprised of a less than symbol, the tag name and a greater than symbol.
	- A closing tag is comprised of a less than symbol, a forward slash, the tag name, and a greater than symbol. 
	- In between these two tags, you can put another HTML box, some texts, a combination of boxes and text, or leave it blank.
	- The whole HTML box then is made up of the opening tag, the contents, and the closing tag, and this is all called **an HTML element.**
	- By default, **a browser will display HTML elements, from the top of the document towards the bottom**, just as they are in your HTML file.

### HTML Attributes
- Attributes are secret bits and pieces that give the browser more information about an HTML element, like how to display it, and what functionality to add. 
- We write attributes in the opening tag of an HTML element, we use attributes to style elements to tell the browser where to go when you click on a link, what file an image element should display, and plenty more. 
- An attribute is made up of a name, an equal symbol, and a value, which is wrapped in single or double quotes.
