In session 9, we learned about top app bar and bottom navigation. Let's go through the rest of the guidelines for Android UI components

## Android UI Components
### Top App Bar
The top app bar displays information & actions relating to the current screen

### Bottom Navigation Bar
It allows movement b/w primary destinations in an app.

### Buttons
Buttons allow users to take actions and make choices, with a single tap.

#### Text Button
- Low emphasis
- These are typically used for less important actions.

#### Outlined Button
- Medium emphasis
- It is the stroke that they have that gives them more emphasis than text buttons
- It can be used for example:
	- Indicating the secondary action 
	- Complementing the primary action

The idea for this app was to make it minimal & clean looking, clutter is not what you want if you are looking for help.
I also wanted to give users a very feature rich app but that required me to create complex navigation links, which was defeating the original purpose & that's when recalling about affordances & signifiers was really helpful to me.

I tried making low fidelity digitally but that confused me a lot, I then took Pen & Paper, created low fidelity wireframes for as many screens as I could think of. 
I remember sitting for days trying to think of what my app would look like, all it took was for me to sketch it out.
I digitzed my wireframes using Figma.
