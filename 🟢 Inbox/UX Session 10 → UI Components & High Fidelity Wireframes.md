### Buttons
Buttons allow users to take actions and make choices, with a single tap.

1. Text Button
	- Low emphasis
	- These are typically used for less important actions.
2. Outlined Button
	- Medium emphasis
	- It is the stroke that they have that gives them more emphasis than text buttons
	- It can be used for example:
		- Indicating the secondary action 
		- Complementing the primary action
