> [!note] What is Usability
> Usability is part of the broader term 'user experience' and refers to intuitiveness and ease of use factors, while interacting with an application interface.

### Heuristic Evaluation
A usability evaluation method which involves having a small set of evaluators examine the intuitiveness and ease of using an interface, based on recognised usability principles or guidelines which are also known as the "heuristics"
\- Jakob Nielsen

## Nielsen's Heuristics
### User control & freedom
- Put the user in charde & give them the ability to do things freely.
- Especially related to undo & redo
- Users should have the ability to "go back" & fix mistakes without hassle.
- Users should always have the option to exit or leave a page directly without having to worry about chooseing to go back. They should feel in control, that no matter where they may go, they should know that there will always be an exit option.

### Help users recognize, diagnose & recover from errors
- Errors are & will be unavoidable, give your user the option to move from them gracefully.

### Aesthetic & minimalist design
- Make sure that everything presented to the user is necessary & useful
- Dialogues should not contain information which is irrevlevant or rarely needed.

### Visibility of system status
- Let the user know what is going on.
- The system should keep the user in the loop by informing them the status of their actions

### Error prevention
- The system should be able to predict suer behavior & should have measure that help in preventing user errors.
- Like showing the password constraints in real time while filling up the password
- Having a confirmation button at the time of payment.

### Consistency & standards
- Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations or actions mean the same thing
- Follow platform conventions
- Use known & common terminologies & icons

### Help & documentation
- Help should contain all relevant data which the user might need while using the system.

### Accelerators, flexibility & efficiency of use
- Make your design flexible, to deal with a variety of situations making it easier for both novice and expert users.

### Recognition rather than recall
- Users should be given options to choose from, instead of having to think of possible options themselves

### Match between system & real world
- Make it more familiar
