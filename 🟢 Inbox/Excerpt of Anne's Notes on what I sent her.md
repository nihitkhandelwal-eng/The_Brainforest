I can’t thank you enough for what you did.  It was so wonderful.  I think the end number is that you cut off $125/per mo. Or $,1,500/per yr.  of the money I have been spending.  Each had meaning at one time, but you are helping us grow past it to a newer, leaner fighting machine.

Rich was a mixed bag.  Last night he got into one of his yelling rages, but today, well he just called to say how much he really appreciated what was done.

I think some of his anger was that I hadn’t acted before, or when he was pushing more directly for changes.  We tried to make him understand that he didn’t have the gift in working with us, in that when he gets louder and angrier, we can’t thing straight, get overly nervous, and then later, we don’t want to care what he things.  I really needed the help to think through decisions.  I think we rebel and say well to hell with it, even though I know I need to be responsible.  He also was able to verbalize his jealousy in that you could work with me to get it done, where he had not been able to.  I tried to emphasize that you have patience, had done homework, and was leading me through discussions on each item while letting me make the choices.  It is two extremely different modes.
