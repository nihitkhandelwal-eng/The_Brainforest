**Persistent doubt concerning one's abilities or accomplishments accompanied by the fear of being exposed as a fraud despite evidence of one's ongoing success**

To put it simply, imposter syndrome is the experience of feeling like a phony in some area of your life, despite any success that you have achieved in that area.

Impostor syndrome is an internal experience of believing that you are not as competent as others perceive you to be, as if you are a fraud.

#### Imposter syndrome can be broken down into five basic types

-   **The Perfectionist**. This type of imposter syndrome involves believing that, unless you were absolutely perfect, you could have done better. You feel like an imposter because your [perfectionistic traits](https://www.verywellmind.com/signs-you-may-be-a-perfectionist-3145233) make you believe that you're not as good as others might think you are.
-   **The Expert**. The expert feels like an imposter because they don't know everything there is to know about a particular subject or topic, or they haven't mastered every step in a process. Because there is more for them to learn, they don't feel as if they've reached the rank of "expert."
-   **The Natural Genius**. In this imposter syndrome type, you may feel like a fraud simply because you don't believe that you are naturally intelligent or competent. If you don't get something right the first time around or it takes you longer to master a skill, you feel like an imposter.
-   **The Soloist**. It's also possible to feel like an imposter if you had to ask for help to reach a certain level or status. Since you couldn't get there on your own, you question your competence or abilities.
-   **The Superperson**. This type of imposter syndrome involves believing that you must be the hardest worker or reach the highest levels of achievement possible and, if you don't, you are a fraud.
