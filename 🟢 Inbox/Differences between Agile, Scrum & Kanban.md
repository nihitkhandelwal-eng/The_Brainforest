### Agile vs Scrum
Scrum is a part of the wider Agile umbrella; Agile is an approach to project management, and Scrum is a method you can use to implement it. 

The key difference between Agile and Scrum is that **Agile is a philosophy about how to successfully deliver software to a customer, while Scrum is a proven methodology for software development teams to follow**.

- There are a few parts of Scrum that are reflective of Agile principles.
	- Short-term development cycles
	- Focus on people, collaboration, and communication
	- Capacity to adapt to changes and feedback
- Several points that make it unique within the philosophy.
	-   Work is organized into sprints that last one to four weeks.
	-   A product backlog keeps a record of what work needs to be done.
	-   Roles are divided into Scrum master, product owner, and development team.
	-   Team members have a short “daily Scrum” update meeting.

### Scrum vs. Kanban
Kanban gets its name from the Japanese word for “signboard.” The method uses a board (virtual or physical) divided into columns that represent different phases of a project. As the project progresses, a sticky-note or card that represents the project gets moved into the next phase, until the project is completed. It’s a great way to visualize the process and spot bottlenecks. 

Unlike Scrum, Kanban places less of an emphasis on fixed timelines, and work happens in a continuous flow. Roles like product owners are not decided at the outset. Many project managers combine Scrum and Kanban concepts together in a hybrid methodology called Scrumban.
