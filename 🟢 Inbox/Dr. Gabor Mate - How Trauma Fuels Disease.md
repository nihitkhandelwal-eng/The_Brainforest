- trauma-based medicine 
	- legal system
		- afflicted and broken
		- incarcerated and punished

- stop at 1h - 39 minutes to go

Washroom AND No Nihit break! :(

Essential to recognize more than individual problems all a part of a much larger problematic whole

disillusionment 
	believe what is not true or reality - lose about the nature of the world we live in
- making us more sick
- Covid - richest best ... had highest Covid - gap between us and reality (US)

Addiction
- 	virtually impossible w/o arrogance - everything proven 
- if only indigenous people who cares, but now general society - fostering addictions
- when people say with disease or addiction "I have ..." (he doesn't talk about it any more because it is implicit)
- used example of detatched cup.  By saying "I am an addiction" - has it's life of its own ... and we have the thing
- manifestation of my life - inside of me.  it's a process inside me.  If I change the process we can change the nature of the disease
- language - I am an addict - identifies person with habit - honesty behind it .. not in denial good thing, ownership, but risk in identifying with behaviors, patterns and such ... nobody is a victim.
- backed in always in recovery
- if underlying healed (inner child) than ... ok, more radical
- recovery (find something) find self.  Loss of self is illness.  Alcoholism (ie.) is not that ... yes drinking, hurting, destroying and needs acknowledgement, but what if addict is outlawed ... so and so human being hurting and suffering through this behavior is better.
- pursuit of enlightenment - pursue more ... similiary recovery spectrum better and better ... but destination is an illusion.
- how to use language ...
- Self-actualization - Abraham Maslow 
	- not normal by regulars standards ... resist social sphere - they avoid culture - people often at odds with their peers
	- NIHIT
	- transcendence channel in service to others as pinnacle.  
- formally incorporate trauma into (alcoholics AA)
	- it would take nothing away, but inform through trauma - just an aspect of myself
	- escape from pain when too small to deal with it
	- the more I know the less imprints to myself and others I meet 
	- sharing stories - by continuing year after year - might cement something not needed - over identify. Like this is who I am - at odds with transcendence
	- if you take care of all the trauma, then so what?  you did the work, steps continue to do well, so all is well
	- does the new patterns help us gain agency?
	- the movement can be dynamic and yet improve (AA)  
	- talked of humility with a misstep in AA 
	- Mate said we stumble and fall and don't always live up to our best, but dispute in not starting back at the front.  Just has to standup again.  Even relapse - showed transformation.  Naturally upsetting
- Parenting
	- parenting instinct share with other mammals - instincts need to be invoked by the environment.
	- children not pick up - heart is breaking, but to fit in, or be inconvenient, shut down parenting instincts.  Donâ€™t listen to the experts, and
	- human beings/mammals evolved - love and connection the very ocean in which human life involves.  This society breaks the connection.  25% women back at worth in 2 weeks - traumatic to the child
	- weaning 3-5 years - hunter gathers
	- recognize basic needs denied
	- some have to go, but look at what children are loosing but make it more positive as best as possible.
	- children by default connect with others than parents - should have been but turn to each other - poor replacement - be aware - do what you can to restore it.  
	- furthermore instead of getting such and such behavior ... (five year old doing homework) - play is very important and should be honored - so five year old chastised if kid could yell back he would say you are not honoring developmental needs.  If met will learn beautifully
	- learning should be a joy - not remodifying.  If we understood needs, then recognize their needs and not them to assist us.  
	- love unconditionally, remain neutral, no anxieties onto them, and also balance found between unconditional love - but not making them love us.  Healthy boundaries, guideposts, when to say no (not just to like me).  
	- check out Gordon Neufeld - greatest developmental psychologist - hold on to your kids
	- Dan Siegel Parenting from the inside out - how not to project all in kids.
- final thing
	- disconnecting teenagers - more on their own agency, more withdrawl, but as a parent person you knew becomes a stranger - so how do I find/maintain open communication
	- withdrawal - healthy individualization - autonomous, self-agency, OR alienation from you and more to peer group - conformity.
	- become individual incorporated with adults, so maturation doesn't necessarily involve alienation from parental generation
	- Thanks you
	- Myth of Normal (September 13) book groundbreaking along with Hungry Ghosts (understand humanity) 
- develop greater compassion for the human condition.
- compassion is present can you see the truth, see it as clearly as you can - need more compassion - and it will become natural attribute of how you move through our world
