4. things like putting on your pajamas and brushing your teeth, can reinforce in your mind that it’s bedtime.
5. Budget 30 Minutes For **Winding Down:** Take advantage of whatever puts you in a state of calm such as soft music, light stretching, reading, and/or relaxation exercises.
6. **Dim Your Lights:** Try to keep away from bright lights because they can hinder the production of melatonin, a hormone that the body creates to facilitate sleep.
7. **Unplug From Electronics:** Build in a 30-60 minute pre-bed buffer time that is device-free. Cell phones, tablets, and laptops cause mental stimulation that is hard to shut off and also generate blue light that may decrease melatonin production.
8. **Test Methods of Relaxation:** Instead of making falling asleep your goal, it’s often easier to focus on relaxation. Meditation, mindfulness, paced breathing, can put you in the right mindset for bed.
9. Get **Daylight Exposure:** Light (especially sunlight) is one of the key drivers of circadian rhythm & melatonin production.
