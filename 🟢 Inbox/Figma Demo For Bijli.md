### Basics
- The blank thing is the canvas, it's like surface of a table that we are working on.
- On top of it, we will add a design like sheets of paper which are here called as **frames**.
	- We can add images, text & shapes to our frames to set up our design
	- How to add frames?
	- It has preloaded setups different screen sizes

---
#### Wireframing
- Wireframing is a way to design a website at the structural level.
- It takes into account, the user needs & user journeys

---

### Tools
- Frames
- Shapes
- Pen
- Text
- Resources
- Comment

---

### Useful Commands
> Shortcuts Menu → Ctrl + Shift + ?
> Command Palette → Ctrl + /

- Space bar to pan & move around
- +/- for zooming in & out
- Cmd/Ctrl + D for duplication

---
### Left & Right Sidebars
- The left sidebar is like a mirror to the canvas ^80f9d8
- The right side bar will have the dimensions & formatting options.
	- You can also perform calculations in the right side bar. (Give Example)
- The right sidebar contains the properties of your objects which can be copied

---
#### Objects
- Hold shift to draw shapes of equal length i.e. squares, equilateral triangle etc
- Rotate the shape OR Curve the edges of the shape
	- Either from the right side panel
	- Or by hovering close to the shape once it is selected
- Select any object & hold `alt`, then hover over different components to see the exact distance from those objects
	- You can move these objects with arrow keys while distances are being shown
	- If you hold shift, it will move large distances, this is called nudging
		- The nudge amount can be adjusted by using the quick command thing

---

#### Groups 
You can group different layers/objects by selecting the objects by `holding Shift` & then `Ctrl+G`.
It comes in handy.

---
### Styles 
- They can be either →
	1. Color styles 
	2. Text styles
- Both text & color styles live independently in the style section & are not tied to any object.

---
### Components
- UI elements that can be re-used across my design
- Main component & instance of the main component
- Main component is a filled diamond shaped & purple in color
- Instance of the component is a blank diamond 
- Components can be accessed from assets menu
