## Basics & Frames
- The blank thing is the canvas, it's like surface of a table that we are working on.
- On top of it, we will add a design like sheets of paper which are here called as **frames**.
	- We can add images, text & shapes to our frames to set up our design
	- Add frames via toolbar or press F
	- It has preloaded things for different screen sizes
	- The left panel is like a mirror to the canvas ^80f9d8
- Shortcuts → Ctrl + Shift + ?


## Shapes
- Use the shape tool
- Hold shift to draw shapes of equal length i.e. squares, equilateral triangle etc
- The lett side bar will show all your shapes i.e. ![[#^80f9d8]]
- The right side bar will have the dimensions which can be changed from there as well
- Rotate the shape OR Curve the edges of the shape
	- Either from the right side panel
	- Or by hovering close to the shape once it is selected
