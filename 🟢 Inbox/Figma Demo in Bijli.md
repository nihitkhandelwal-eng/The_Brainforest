Hello All!
My name is Nihit & this is going to be a introductory demo to Figma

---

- Figma is a UI Design software
- Cloud Based i.e. Cross Platform
- We will build a mood tracking app
- Figma Web v/s App → Font installer is required in web version

## Basics & Frames
- The blank thing is the canvas, it's like surface of a table that we are working on.
- On top of it, we will add a design like sheets of paper which are here called as **frames**.
	- We can add images, text & shapes to our frames to set up our design
	- Add frames via toolbar or press F
	- It has preloaded things for different screen sizes
	- The left panel is like a mirror to the canvas ^80f9d8
- Shortcuts → Ctrl + Shift + ?


## Tools & Sidebars
- Use the shape tool
- Hold shift to draw shapes of equal length i.e. squares, equilateral triangle etc
- The lett side bar will show all your shapes i.e. ![[#^80f9d8]]
- The right side bar will have the dimensions which can be changed from there as well.
	- You can also perform calculations in the right side bar
- Rotate the shape OR Curve the edges of the shape
	- Either from the right side panel
	- Or by hovering close to the shape once it is selected


- Select any object & hold alt, then hover over different components to see the exact distance from those objects
- You can move these objects with arrow keys while distances are being shown
- If you hold shift, it will move large distances, this is called nudging
	- The nudge amount can be adjusted by using the quick command thing

- Properties can be copied & pasted


### Styles 
- They can be color styles & text styles
- Both text & color styles live independently in the style section & are not tied to any object

### Components
- UI elements that can be re-used across my design
- Main component & instance of the main component
- Main component is a filled diamond shaped & purple in color
- Instance of the component is a blank diamond 
- Components can be accessed from assets menu
