Have a common fucking decency to tell the truth.

It reminds me almost always of [[Christopher Hitchens]] & [[Richard Dawkins]] because I heard it from them.

It basically comes down to respecting the intellect of the person rather than "their culture" or "their beliefs".
It comes down to people witholding information/truth from people in the garb that it might hurt them or hurt their beliefs.

It is similar to leveling with someone, because you try to be honest with them but the difference here is that, leveling with people does not involve as much hurt as this does. Initial reactions won't be pleasing to a people pleaser, but that's not your concern, it should never be. Otherwise where would development of the human mind be at this stage!
