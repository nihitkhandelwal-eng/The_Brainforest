This is where we step into Ideate i.e. Step 3 of the EDIPT Process
## Information Architecture
- It defines how content will be structured & presented to a user when they are interacting with your design.
- It includes
	- Navigation 
	- Content

**It is important because** it makes it easier for the user to understand & navigate through information that hey want to discover.
Information architecture provides designers a bird's eye view of the entire product.

## Navigation in UI Design
It is the act of **moving between screens of an app to complete different tasks**

Different types of Navigation
1. Lateral Navigation
2. Forward Navigation
3. Reverse Navigation

### Lateral Navigation
it refers to moving between screens at the same level of hierarchy there are three types of lateral navigation.

- Bottom navigation bar
	- Top level destinations that need to be accessible from anywhere in the app
	- Should provide access to three to five top level destinations
	- Mobile or tablet only
- Navigation drawers
	- These are appropriate for five or more top level destinations
	- It can also be used for apps with two or more levels of navigation hierarchy
	- For quick navigation between unrelated destinations
- Tabs
	- They organize and allow navigation between groups of content that are *related and at the same level of hierarchy.*
	- Each tab *should contain content that is distinct* from other tabs in a set

**Note: an app's primary navigation component should *provide access to all destinations the top level**

### Forward Navigation
it refers to moving between screens at consecutive levels of hierarchy, steps in a flow or across an app

- Hierarchical
	- Hierarchical pattern is a standard site structure with an index page & a series of subpages
- Hub & Spoke
	- Uses a single central screen which acts to enable the user to explore different sections i.e. spokes of the app.
	- Users can't navigate b/w spokes but must return to the hub, instead.
	- This is a good way of minimizing onscreen noise & works very well for apps that are more concerned with task execution than presenting large volumes of content.
- Direct 
	- Search allows users to quickly access screens anywhere within an app's information architecture.
- Wizards
	- A wizard is a series of screens or dialogue boxes walking users through from start to completion.

### Reverse Navigation
It refers to backward movement between screens

- It moves users chronologically through their recent screen history or upwards through an app's hierarchy.
- Upward navigation allows users to navigate one level upwards within a single app's hierarchy, until the app's home or top-level screen is reached.


## Sitemap
Site map helps to identify the structure of mobile/website applications.

- It shows how the navigation should be structured
- It shows the relationship between different pages
- It is the first tangible deliverable showing what you'll be creating.
- A sitemap is created based on the user flow of the application

### Journaling My Sitemap
For creating the sitemap for my app, I tried to keep the interface clutter free & as clean as possible.

So, I created a Level 1 navigation comprising of 4 screens
1. Home
2. Journal
3. Seek Help
4. Profile

I tried creating a clean & minimal UI with a mix of navigation styles. 
I emphasized those components which were highly requested during my research process & made them Level 1 Navigation, so that most users can find what they need quickly.
