### Affinity Mapping
- It's a method for organizing related facts into distinct clusters.
	- It's to put the user data you gather together & start making sense of it.
- A lot of sticky notes are involved
1. Step 1
	- Put all your information on a wall or on a digital wall
	- The idea is to assign each user their own color sticky note & go from there.
	- Also note down things you observed, this may not be said by the user but it is important
2. Step 2
	- It's time to categorize & subcategorize++
	- Don't think too much, you can always re-categorize later
3. Step 3
	- Analyse the categories
	- What hidden categories have emerged from this activity?
	- Were there any hidden categories that you weren't aware of?
	- Often these categories will drive the research of future studies
4. Step 4
	- Document your findings & share it with relevant people
5. Step 5
	- Since the design is iterative, you affinity diagram should be as well.
	- Keep it up to date by visiting it often.

I divided the data into 10 categories, comprising of User statement, Age, motivation, goals, pain points, personality traits and technology expertise.  

While categorizing, I started to see the pattern in user responses.
Where earlier I thought that people with older age group would feel unhappy about unwanted groups, I was surprised to this in people between 21 to 30 years of age and there main concerns were -
