### Affinity Mapping
- It's a method for organizing related facts into distinct clusters.
	- It's to put the user data you gather together & start making sense of it.
- A lot of sticky notes are involved
1. Step 1
	- Put all your information on a wall or on a digital wall
	- The idea is to assign each user their own color sticky note & go from there.
	- Also note down things you observed, this may not be said by the user but it is important
2. Step 2
	- It's time to categorize & subcategorize++
	- Don't think too much, you can always re-categorize later
3. Step 3
	- Analyse the categories
	- What hidden categories have emerged from this activity?
	- Were there any hidden categories that you weren't aware of?
	- Often these categories will drive the research of future studies
4. Step 4
	- Document your findings & share it with relevant people
5. Step 5
	- Since the design is iterative, you affinity diagram should be as well.
	- Keep it up to date by visiting it often.

### Journaling affinity mapping
- After conducting the interviews, I gained insights into what the user's pain points, motivations & goals are. 
- To get better insights about this, I used affinity mapping methodology to find out significant patterns & data in distinct clusters.
- I divided the data into 10 categories
	1. Age
	2. Location
	3. Profession
	4. Marital Status
	5. User Statement
	6. Pain Points
	7. Motivations
	8. Goals
	9. Coping Habits
	10. Opinion on therapy

While & after categorizing, I saw some deviation from my assumptions in user responses.
- My assumptions about people's opinion on therapy & on seeking help were not as realistic as they turned out to be.
- Majority of my sample group have trust issues when it comes to mental health.

I also noticed some convergent & divergent insights from the data I organized using affinity maps.
The convergent insights are shown in the "Motivations & Goals" & "Apprehension & Queries" themes in the affinity diagram.
