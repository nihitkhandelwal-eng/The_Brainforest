### What is it?
- It’s a move to protect your king & activate your rook.
- It’s the only time in chess, when you can move 2 pieces in one move.

### Rules of Castling
- The king moves 2 squares to the right or left & the rook moves directly to the other side of the king.
- For castling to happen, it is mandatory that **neither the rook or king have moved & there are no pieces in the way**.
- You can also not castle when in check, into check or through check. 
	- i.e. if your king would cross path with a check or if after castling, it would be in check.
