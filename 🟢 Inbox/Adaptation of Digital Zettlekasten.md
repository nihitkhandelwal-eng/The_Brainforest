### The Folder Rebellion
We have this tendency to classify everything in a folder, be it in our analog system or in the computers.

Thinking in terms of systems, folders are can be classified as **rigid, linear & top-down**

The Zettlekasten method provided an alternative but in doing so, it completely abolished folders & as rigid as they are, we crave structure.
