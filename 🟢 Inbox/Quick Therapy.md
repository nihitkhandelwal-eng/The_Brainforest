I was about to do a DTR entry for this one but it is not a Dysfuctional Thought, so I'm here.
This primarily stems from the idea that dad, mom & many others have been vocal about the idea of getting through therapy quickly, like having 3 sessions in a week. 

The analogy in my head that just came in Oct 2022 is that of nasal steroid.
I am sure once I have the prompts for 7 C's of Note Taking, this would be a much better note, but for now let's do it in a sandbox mode.

Everytime I try to do an analogy of mental health with physical health, the concept of time & uncertainty comes up in your face.
So, therapy!? 
How long would it take?
Why is it taking so long?
Just get done with it in a week or two?

I have been sneezing for about 20 years now, but never once in my life have I been told to empty an entire bottle of fluticasone in my nose.

The same is true for analogy b/w therapies for mental health & therapies for physical health.
Therapy is treated more like a talk session than an actual thing that works & is evidence based. Rather people would emphasize about meditation, relaxation, going outside, being busy etc..

I used to get angry about this thing but now I get it, they do the same for physical health.

I have been advised multiple times for getting treatment with homeopathy for my allergic rhinitis.
