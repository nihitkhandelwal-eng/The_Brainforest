#action 
- Actionable things I can do on a note
- #action/✔todo is straightforward but this will evolve once I explore [[Plugin Exploration#^b3d766|Task Based Plugins]] 


#excalidraw | #excalidraw/🖊sketch 
- Every excalidraw file is tagged with `#excalidraw`   
- Every idea that I have expressed in excalidraw is tagged with `#excalidraw/🖊sketch`

 #journal | #journal/highlight
 - The tag `#journal` in itself is not something I have used yet, might use it later at some point
 - `#journal/highlight` is used when I want to highlight any daily note on the calendar with a star
 - Journal tags based on primary feel of the day
	 - #journal/happy → #journal/funny | #journal/proud | #journal/confident | #journal/optimistic | #journal/creative
	- #journal/surprised → #journal/intentional | #journal/focussed | #journal/energized | #journal/productive
	- #journal/procrastinating → #journal/anxious | #journal/sick | #journal/discouraged | #journal/lonely | #journal/disappointed
	- #journal/bad → #journal/depressed | #journal/numb | #journal/devastated | #journal/furious | #journal/terrified
	- #journal/euphoric → #journal/musical


#placeholder
- I have a lot of placeholder tags, this will be sorted out once the workshop is done

#status
- This needs to be written well
- I will be making changes as the workshop progresses on
- Right now, I have created the tags #status/1️⃣stage-1 & #status/1️⃣stage-2 
	- `#status/1️⃣stage-1` will be added to all
	- If the note is mature, I will replace it with `#status/1️⃣stage-2` 
	- For now, this will be it
- I have other tags like #status/🌲evergreen | #status/🍃boat | #status/💭think | #status/🔓opinion     
	- Opinion is something that I have little knowledge about & I am actively looking for knowledge in that topic
