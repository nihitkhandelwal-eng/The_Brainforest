> Regulating oneself, is a process! Making choices and decisions (small or large) gives one self-ownership of our own life! Live with intention!

CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) is based on the idea that the way you see yourself, the world and other people can affect your thoughts and feelings, and can ultimately lead to mental health problems ... BUT you can change the way you think.



### Cognitive Distortions

Research suggests that people develop cognitive distortions **as a way of coping with adverse life events**. The more prolonged and severe those adverse events are, the more likely it is that one or more cognitive distortions will form.

1. **All-or-Nothing** Thinking or **Polarized Thinking**
	- Inability or unwillingness to see shades of gray.
	- Seeing things in terms of extremes
	- Something is either fantastic or awful
	- You are either perfect or a total failure
2. Overgeneralization
	- It can lead to overly negative thoughts about yourself and your environment based on only one or two experiences.
3. Mental Filter
	- Similar to Overgeneralization
	- Focus on Negative Excluding Positive
4. Disqualifying the Positive
	- Disqualifying the Positive as True
	- Rejects the positive instead of embracing it.
	- For example, a person who receives a positive review at work might reject the idea that they are a competent employee and attribute the positive review to political correctness, or to their boss simply not wanting to talk about their employee’s performance problems.
	- This is an especially malignant distortion since it can facilitate the continuation of negative thought patterns even in the face of strong evidence to the contrary.
5. Jumping to Conclusions → Mind Reading
	- The inaccurate belief that we know what another person is thinking.
	- Of course, it is possible to have an idea of what other people are thinking, but this distortion refers to the negative interpretations that we jump to.
6. Jumping to Conclusions → Fortune Telling
	- A sister distortion to mind reading, fortune telling refers to the tendency to make conclusions and predictions based on little to no evidence and holding them as gospel truth.
	- One example of fortune-telling is a young, single man predicting that he will never find love or have a committed and happy relationship based only on the fact that he has not found it yet. There is simply no way for him to know how his life will turn out, but he sees this prediction as fact rather than one of several possible outcomes.
7. Magnification, Catastrophizing or Minimization
	- Also known as the “Binocular Trick” for its stealthy skewing of your perspective.
	- This distortion involves exaggerating or minimizing the meaning, importance, or likelihood of things.
	- An athlete who is generally a good player but makes a mistake may magnify the importance of that mistake and believe that he is a terrible teammate, while an athlete who wins a coveted award in her sport may minimize the importance of the award and continue believing that she is only a mediocre player.
8. Emotional Reasoning
	- Emotional reasoning refers to the acceptance of one’s emotions as fact. It can be described as “I feel it, therefore it must be true.”
9. Should Statements
	- The tendency to make “should” statements.
	- Should statements are statements that you make to yourself about what you “should” do, what you “ought” to do, or what you “must” do.
	- They can also be applied to others, imposing a set of expectations that will likely not be met.
	- When we hang on too tightly to our “should” statements about ourselves, the result is often guilt that we cannot live up to them.
	- When we cling to our “should” statements about others, we are generally disappointed by failure to meet our expectations, leading to anger and resentment.
10. Labeling & Mislabeling
	- Extreme Labels on self & others
	- These tendencies are basically extreme forms of overgeneralization, in which we assign judgments of value to ourselves or to others based on one instance or experience.
	- Mislabelling refers to the application of highly emotional, loaded, and inaccurate language or unreasonable language when labelling.
11. Personalization
	- As the name implies, this distortion involves taking everything personally or assigning blame to yourself without any logical reason to believe you are to blame.
	- Severe examples : believing that you are the cause for every instance of moodiness or irritation in those around you.
12. Control Fallacies
	- A control fallacy manifests as one of two beliefs: 
		1. that we have no control over our lives and are helpless victims of fate 
		2. that we are in complete control of ourselves and our surroundings, giving us responsibility for the feelings of those around us. 
	- Both beliefs are damaging, and both are equally inaccurate. No one is in complete control of what happens to them, and no one has absolutely no control over their situation.
13. Fallacy of Fairness
	- The assumption of an inherently fair world is not based in reality and can foster negative feelings when we are faced with proof of life’s unfairness. 
	- A person who judges every experience by its perceived fairness has fallen for this fallacy, and will likely feel anger, resentment, and hopelessness when they inevitably encounter a situation that is not fair.
14. Fallacy of Change
	- Another ‘fallacy’ distortion involves expecting others to change if we pressure or encourage them enough. 
	- This distortion is usually accompanied by a belief that our happiness and success rests on other people, leading us to believe that forcing those around us to change is the only way to get what we want. 
	- A man who thinks “If I just encourage my wife to stop doing the things that irritate me, I can be a better husband and a happier person” is exhibiting the fallacy of change.
15. Always Being Right
	- Perfectionists and those struggling with [[Imposter Syndrome]] will recognize this distortion – it is the belief that we must always be right.
	- For example, the internet commenters who spend hours arguing with each other over an opinion or political issue far beyond the point where reasonable individuals would conclude that they should “agree to disagree” are engaging in the “Always Being Right” distortion. 
		- To them, it is not simply a matter of a difference of opinion, it is an intellectual battle that must be won at all costs.
16. Heaven's Reward Fallacy
	- The “Heaven’s Reward Fallacy” manifests as a belief that one’s struggles, one’s suffering, and one’s hard work will result in a just reward


### Criticism
Common criticisms of the diagnosis of cognitive distortion relate to *epistemology* and the theoretical basis. If the perceptions of the patient differ from those of the therapist, it may not be because of intellectual malfunctions but because the patient has different experiences. In some cases, depressed subjects appear to be "sadder but wiser"
