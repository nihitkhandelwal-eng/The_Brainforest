- Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development
- Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. 
	- Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.
- Agile isn't defined by a set of ceremonies or specific development techniques. Rather, agile is a group of methodologies that demonstrate a commitment to tight feedback cycles and continuous improvement.
- Teams choose agile so they can respond to changes in the marketplace or feedback from customers quickly without derailing a year's worth of plans. 
	- "Just enough" planning and shipping in small, frequent increments lets your team gather feedback on each change and integrate it into future plans at minimal cost.

### Agile Philosophy in a Nutshell
There are four values that drive the Agile philosophy of project management:

-   **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
-   **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
-   **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
-   **Responding to change** over following a plan

### Agile Frameworks
- Since the publication of agile manifesto many agile frameworks have emerged such as Scrum, Kanban, Lean & Extreme Programming
	- Kanban is a popular framework used to implement agile software development. It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.
- Each embodies the core principles of frequent iteration, continuous learning & high quality in its own way.
