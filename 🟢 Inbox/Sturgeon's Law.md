Sturgeon's law (or Sturgeon's revelation) is an adage stating "**ninety percent of everything is crap**". The adage was coined by Theodore Sturgeon, an American science fiction author and critic.

This is [not technically Sturgeon's Law](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellThisIsNotThatTrope "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellThisIsNotThatTrope"), but rather Sturgeon's Revelation. Sturgeon's Law, properly formulated, is the broader _Nothing is always absolutely so_. But they mean effectively the same thing, and when people refer to "Sturgeon's Law", both on and off [This Very Wiki](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/ThisVeryWiki "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/ThisVeryWiki"), the "90%" quote is what they mean.

So, by extension 90% of your life is crap?

It's okay for me to write horrible stuff because I am just exercising my writing muscles.
