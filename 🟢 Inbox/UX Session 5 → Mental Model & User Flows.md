## Mental Models
In the area of user experience design (UX design), and the human-computer interaction (HCI) in general, we pay close attention to three leading (software) models:
1. Implementation model
	- How does this work ?
2. Mental model ^e91eb2
	- How do users think or believe this works ?
	- i.e. this is based on past experiences & intuitive perceptions
3. Representational model.
	- How is this presented to the user ?

### Mental Models
Mental Models help *shape actions & behavior, influence what people pay attention to while interacting with products.*

- It helps define how people approach solving problems or think how a task will be done.
- If the product doesn't match the user's mental model or is very far from how users think, then the users will find the product hard to learn and use.
- We have to design considering the mental model of different personas & then integrate it into our design.

## Customer Journey Map
### What is User Journey Map?
- A journey map is a visualization of the process that a person goes through in order to accomplish a goal.
- It starts by compiling a series of user actions into a timeline.
- Next, the timeline is fleshed out with user thoughts & emotions in order to create a narrative.

5 Key Elements
- Actor i.e. a POV
- Scenarios + Expectations
- Journey Phases
- Actions, Mindsets & Emotions
- Opportunities

### Journaling Customer Journey Map
I created a journey map for my persona that would help me understand the interaction touch points and emotional scale while performing a task. I created 3 journey maps, one for each persona.
  
Analyzing the journey map, I can see at what points my user would feel angry or frustrated so I could find a way to improve experience at those phases.  

Different personas had different approach to addressing their mental health problems but I did find convergence in braoder perspectives, i.e. the pain points & expectations are somewhat similar, irrespective of the personas.

In case of Neelu (Affirmative Neelu), I mapped out her journey to address her increased stress levels & persitent low mood, in order to identify the pain points & the opportunities to solve them.
Most of the pain points I encountered here were the ones, which are with me since the research & interview processes. However, mapping user journey gave me insights about different perspectives to look at the poin point & opportunities to address them."

## User Flow 
- A user flow is a series of steps which helps the user achieve his/her goal.
- As designers, we must ensure the users should be able to achieve their goals in the most efficient way as per the mental model of the user.

### Journaling User Flow
I created user flows for all the major features available in the app.  
  
My aim was to give the users a minimal & clutter free experience, when they want to seek help or just feel better.  
Hence, I tried keeping things very similar & consistent throughout my flows.
