- Scrum is an Agile methodology that is designed to develop products in an environment susceptible to change. 
- In Scrum, delivery cycles are called “sprints,” and generally last one to four weeks. 
- Work is incremental and builds on previous work. 
- Scrum teams are usually small, typically ranging from three to nine people, & include a Scrum master & a product owner. 
- Communication with team members and stakeholders is consistent so that feedback is constant and changes can be made accordingly.

In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:

1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
4.  _Repeat_

Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it. Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and interactions.


### Scrum Theory
- Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. 
	- Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed. 
	- Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.

- Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk. 
- Scrum engages groups of people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or acquire such skills as needed.

### The 3 Pillars of Scrum
Scrum is built on 3 pillars & five values (Courage, Focus, Commitment, Respect & Openness)
-   **Transparency:** All players involved have complete access to information, including progress and goals.
	- The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work.
	- Transparency enables Inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading & wasteful.
-   **Adaptation:** The project and work can change to mirror new priorities.
-   **Inspection:** The team strives to continuously improve the product and the process.
	- Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change.


### Scrum artifacts
- Artifacts are something that we make, like a tool to solve a problem. 
- In scrum, these three artifacts are 
	- a product backlog
		- Team's todo list
	- a sprint backlog 
	- an increment  (done)


### Sprints
- A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work.
- With scrum, a product is built in a series of iterations called sprints that break down big, complex projects into bite-sized pieces.
- In order to plan your upcoming sprint, you use the sprint planning meeting!
	- It's a collaborative event where the team answers two basic questions: 
	1. What work can get done in this sprint 
	2. How will the chosen work get done?

- Choosing the right work items for Sprint is a collaborative effort between the product owner, scrum master & development team. The product owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve & the product backlog items that, upon completion, word achieve the Sprint goal.
- During a sprint, the team checks in during the daily scrum, or standup, about how the work is progressing. 
	- The goal of this meeting is to surface any blockers and challenges that would impact the teams ability to deliver the sprint goal.
- After a sprint, the team demonstrates what they’ve completed during the sprint review. This is your team’s opportunity to showcase their work to stakeholders and teammates before it hits production.
- Round out your sprint cycle with my favorite meeting, the sprint retrospective. This is your teams opportunity to identify areas of improvement for the next sprint. With that, you’re ready to start your next sprint cycle.
