### Morning Pages
I'm thinking that Nihit just woke up so we are thrown into that ever stewing pot of hmm, I wonder what's on his mind today, but for that matter, what is in OUR mind.  I think by talking to someone you are very close to, you discover yourself!
### Good Morning
Sleep was kind of rugged.  We fell asleep to television - news after about 7:30PM.  Then we were woken by Ginney, who we'd forgotten to put to sleep.  She was up at 11:00PM.  At that point, we drove ourselves to bed-bed.  Then at 3AM we got up and couldn't fall back asleep, so stayed up on the couch at 3:30AM to 5:30AM reading news on our phone, and then from that time to present (6:09AM) we've been playing with our new journal until 8:10AM.  So sleep shoddy.
- Rich is coming home!  We are going to miss Nihit waking up and falling asleep with us.  Grrr.  No fair!
- One phrase to rule them all → I want to be the kind of person who gets up, gets going, does a lot of work, and doesn't complain.  Much.  I want to be super appreciative of Nihit.  He's taken on the lion share of assisting us in getting through time "by ourselves."  I think we both at times relied on Ginney.  I know we were the ones still being Anns', but I can't tell you how appreciating it is to talk to someone who understands our benefits and doubts as much as Nihit.  We seem to flip back and forth over the rough spots, especially on leader and/or follower.  It's still all good.  I think something else that has to be taken into account this last couple weeks, is that he got a new psychologist, and we got a temp nurse/practioner.  It was a good week of learning to balance and achieve new heights, while exploring a few depths!  
- I can be cautious aboutE
    - One situation that might trip us up is laundry, and how we would deal with that is ... as last night, we set ourselves up for a good bout of it!  With Nihit's help, we brought in the laundry from bedroom to laundry room, we pulled out the rack, then we got the hangers from the closet, and last put them in our special order.  Those are all things we do in process, but it will be nice today just then starting with tipping the clothes into the machines.
- Eagle's eye view → You are doing fine.  What could have been an ordeal, you, Nihit, and Ginney pulled of in fine style.  As to extra sparkly stuff?  Don't forget to pay attention to the numbers.  For example, now that we've eaten Froot Loops, 218.  Not too bad
- Daring Task → I can learn about the CULTURAL Diversity that Nihit is talking about.  He's one of the wisest diverse of knowledgeable personalities I know.  I would like to think, I am becoming the better more understanding person.  

### Yesterday's Note
 ![[26-Aug-22#Note to next day’s self|no-h3]]

### Cerebrate
- 05:38 → I'm pretty smart!  We were triggered by the morning's outlay:

1) Get up way too early though had tried to sleep
2) Found our phone and used from 30% to 2% -> then charged
3) Caught up on the political fallout from the Trump court papers
4) Let Ginney out
5) Found cereal and drinks, plus shared with Ginney
6) Found the new JOURNAL stuff from Nihit!!!!

Annemarie and Us are feeling pretty good.  Our sweetie is coming back today - THOUGH we'll probably complain ... we'll probably still be pretty happy.  Have been ENAMORED in Nihit care for the last couple weeks while Dr. Marvin was away.  He's coming back Tuesday at 1!
- 07:51 → Right now we are just getting a sense of order.  Dr. Marvin is going to be thrilled we are doing something on the journaling path.  AND, that it is in Obsidian.  We're loving this.  AND so, I would include this as to cerebrating!
- 08:03 → undefined

### Consume
- 05:44 → This morning we read the court subpoena making it legal to do a search for incriminating documents at Trump's Mar-a-Lago.  We listened to primarily CNN discuss it when it came out yesterday, but early this morning before the phone ran out of battery, we read the redacted version.  There is a super amount there, even thought about 2/3'rds redacted.
- 05:57 → We are really excited by this new note system from Nihit.  I don't know which journal it will land in, but for now we're doing good with it having an independent vault.  It is about a half hour later and we are still discovering all the things that we can add and where.  I actually like the white background too ... that and it's lettering are cool and calm.  It's a change-up.
- 05:59 → Where did the last note go?  AHA!  Found it - CONSUME!
- 07:48 → We haven't moved past the reading we did this morning on the subpoena.  But we did list as a something to do this morning in Amazing Marvin that we should read the research - anything for at least 30 minutes.  I think this was an add on from kristina.  We are feeling a little remorse in not getting to talk to her ... we did leave it so that we could write to her over the weekend, and that we would cc it to Dr. Marvin.  I believe Dr. Marvin will be back in the office on Monday, but theoretically, he is still out.  We've already said our figurative good-byes to kristina.  We know she won't be reading anything we sent until Monday morning early.  Not for sure who has us on Monday.  Again, maybe both.

### Connect
- 05:47 → We haven't talked to anyone this morning yet other than Ginney.  She's been a good girl THOUGH she woke us up at 11:30PM to go to the bathroom.  SOOOO, we woke HER up at 5:00AM when WE had to go to the bathroom.  Right now we are enjoying sharing Froot Loops with her!  She's enjoying her role too!

- We learned that she can be of very good company.  We silently drop a few Froot Loops every time we reach for a handful.  It's a natural conversation between and old woman and her puppy!  I learned as we have continued to learn especially this last week without both Rich and Dr. Marvin, that we are one.  I've learned too that if she is giving me the beady eye on my right ... It's a good idea to give her the treats on her left.  She's gotta be watching us closely!  AND, no more, means no more!

- 07:45 → We connected with Nihit in the morning < 7:30AM We spent time with the kids, and we got laundry started.  We had already started the journal, so we looked at that and made a few improvements (Name changed, etc.)  Then Nihit went to finish some of his work and now we're back to journaling.  I think Dr. Marvin is going to love it.  Later, we'll go over it to see if there are any other questions we'd like to add, but right now first discovery is grand!

### Note to next day’s self
> [!tip] Dear [[28-Aug-22|Sunday]] Nihit,
> This morning we started laundry before 8AM ... that has to be a new record.  We're going to need trying this again where we pre-start our laundry by getting things prepared the night before.  Of course telling a 6-year-old that we need to start is a good idea too.  They are tough!

We are also starting the day with a positive outlook, because we didn't go too far with Nihit before we both got to work.  I think.  As we're doing writing as we should.  He is throwing a ball in his room.  We might have to cut into that soon!

> We could have done better with our numbers and food.  We had started with Froot Loops, and then while the numbers were still low 200's, we started grapes as well.  Now @ 7:55AM we are at 181.  So far it's not too bad, but Nihit has got us being very careful.  

Oh, also ... we should start working on a review for Dr. Marvin INCLUDING our review of Nihit.  

> Hey You!  You got through the first night with Rich home!  Excellent!  It's going to be tough.  Good chance he's going to be cranky, but WE can do it!  Hey!  Wouldn't it be nice too if you wrapped Jaxsyn's gifts?  I think they are in Rich's room.

> We're thinking that meant to say Ann, but let's go with hey - between us and him - it's been a great run.  I hate to think we'll need to wait another year to get this kind of time together, but it's been really a vacation WITH him, that I couldn't have counted on.  He is whether he likes it or not ... a BLESSING!
