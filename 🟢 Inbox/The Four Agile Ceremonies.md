> An Agile ceremony is an event in the Agile process when your team meets to discuss what their next course of action is. It's a fancy term to describe a normal meeting during the agile process.

- Ceremonies are a moment of celebration
- These celebrations all happen fairly consistently at key milestones of our lives.
- The term "agile ceremony" comes from the concept of celebrating key milestones. However, they are less about celebrations and more about establishing consistent checkpoints in the project lifecycle.
