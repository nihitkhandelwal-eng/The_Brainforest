	- It should be accesible & obvious for your target personas
	- It should be actionable
2. Be concise

	- Eliminate Redundancy
3. Avoid double negatives
4. Avoid Jargon
5. Use specific verbs whenver possible
6. Make the copy consistent
7. Write in active voice

### Wireframes
- It is a skeleton of a page.
- Used because it allows the designer to plan the layout and interaction of an interface without being distracted by colours, typeface choices and copy text.
- Mostly limited to monochromatic colour schemes, with boxes and lines representing copy, pictures and all the interactive elements on the page.

1. Low Fidelity
2. High Fidelity
