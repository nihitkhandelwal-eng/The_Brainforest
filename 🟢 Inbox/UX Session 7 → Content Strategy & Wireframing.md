### UX Writing Principles
Good UX writing makes flows simpler, actions clearer & choices easier. It reduces complexity & lets people do what they want.

1. Clear
	- Content should be easy to understand for your personas
		- It should be relevant & clear
		- It should be actionable
	- Avoid double negatives
	- Avoid Jargon
	- Use specific verbs whenver possible
2. Concise
	- Avoid long blocks of text
	- Eliminate Redundancy
	- Don't over communicate
	- Use numerals
3. Familiar
	- Write in active voice
	- Use "I" where user wants to tell the system what to do. This will give the user a feeling of personal interaction with  the system
4. Responsive
	- Responsive also means the interface provides some form of feedback. The interface should talk back to the user to inform them about what’s happening. Have you pressed that button successfully? How would you know? The button should display a ‘pressed’ state to give that feedback. Perhaps the button text could change to “Loading…” and it’s state disabled. Is the software stuck or is the content loading? Play a spinning wheel or show a progress bar to keep the user in the loop.
5. Consistent
6. Attractive
7. Efficient
8. Forgiving
	- Provide user a way to move out of a difficult situation gracefully
	- Avoid All CAPS

### Wireframes
- It is a skeleton of a page.
- Used because it allows the designer to plan the layout and interaction of an interface without being distracted by colours, typeface choices and copy text.
- Mostly limited to monochromatic colour schemes, with boxes and lines representing copy, pictures and all the interactive elements on the page.

1. Low Fidelity
2. High Fidelity

- Both Sketch & Digital can be done, but sketch is recommended by Nihit.
- Many people make high-fidelity wireframes sketches before moving to digital wireframes.
- Rapid iteration, inexpensive, increased creativity, less learning curves are some of the advantages of high-fidelity *sketch* wireframe.
