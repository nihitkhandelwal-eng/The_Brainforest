## Research
Research is the systematic study of understanding target users and their requirements. It helps us clear our assumptions we have about our users and their problems.

> *Designers own the solution & users own the problem.*

This means designers should never ask users for solutions & if users tell solutions, designers must ask the "why" behind it.

### How to Research for Designing
- Keep user at the center
- Sympathy vs Empathy
	- Sympathy is I know how you feel 
	- Empathy is I feel how you feel
		- Avoiding errors before users can make them is an empathetic element.

### Defining Target Demographics
1. Age
2. Occupation
3. Location

- Try to get people who you don't know.
- Find extreme users → the idea being, that they are able to voice out problems faced by most users as they use the product more.

- **Extract user stories**, experiences & insights about user's behavior, goals, pain points around the problem you are trying to solve.
	- Finding your user's goals, motivations & pain points are the key findings to any research.

- Specify agenda, time & purpose → in general.
- Prepare questionaire in advance not in real time

### Interviews

![[Interview Flowchart.png|400]]

- The 3 key Indicators
	1. Goals → describes what the users want to accomplish by using your product
		- *Example: To lose 10 Kgs*
	2. Motivation → is why they want to accomplish it.
		- *Example: Losing weight to stay healthy & fit.*
	3. Pain Points → are the frustrations of the users. What are they struggling with?
		- *Example: Exercising daily is difficult because of busy schedule*

- Write down a full introduction so you can read off the script
	- This would contain **a list of all the questions or themes you want to discuss**

- Note down the metadata about the interview i.e. Date, time & location of interview
- Tips for interviews
	- Let them know the **reason you want to talk**
	- Talk and inquire about user's life instead of validating your idea.
	- Don't tell them what their problem is and don't ask for their solutions.
	- Talk less and listen more.
	- There are no right or wrong answers.

#### Beginning the interview
- Get to know the user, their routine, behavior, habits & lifestyle, use of technology.
- What does their typical day look like?
- When do they normally first use the internet on a typical day?
- When do they use their phone first?
- What kind of apps or websites do they regularly use?
- Any lifestyle questions related to your topic.

#### Getting into themes
1. Start by Defining Broader Themes
	- Think about themes you are trying to uncover, not specific questions just yet.
2. Break down your bigger themes to specific questions making them more answerable.
	- Questions which provoke descriptive answers
		- What feature do you use...?
		- What would keep you from using this...?
		- What do you think can be improved about....? Why?
3. Don't ask questions that will influence the answer
	- Can you tell me about your experience this happened....? 
4. Ask about specific moments in the past
	- Try & remember any instance when you.... , tell me how did you feel then?
	- How did you feel when this happened?
	- Don't ask generic experiences
5. Prioritize open-ended questions
	- Give your users some room to elaborate their answers.
6. **Don't provoke yes or no** answers

#### Topic Specific Questions
- Tell me a story about the last time ................
	- This is an open ended question, we want to learn things about their experience & then dig in
	- What was hardest?
	- *Why was that hard?*
	- How do you solve it now?
	- Why is that solution not awesome?
	- Take note of emotions your customer experiences → Helps in empathizing.

[[Insights from Interviews]]

### Interview Journal
- I interviewed 6 users for my app which would help the user in improving their mental well being. These were one-on-one interviews either in person or on video call.  
- The users were in the age group of 18-40.  
- 50% of the users were from tier 1 city & 50% from tier 2 city.  
  
- I asked them questions which gave me a rough idea as to how they deal with stressors & what is their response to that.  
	1. How often do they feel depressed / stressed / anxious / frustrated /angry?  
	2. How do they deal with it?  
	3. Have they used any app/website to assist them in their mental well being?  
	4. What is the process they go through while booking a therapy session.  
  
After going through some of my interviews, I discovered a few common patterns which were solidified by the time I did all my interviews. These insights & patterns were :-  
  
1. A majority of the sample group experience stress & low mood on a frequent basis  
2. They usually confide in either their spouse, sibling or a best friend  
3. Majority of the sample group (66%) have not gone for therapy.  
4. Majority of the sample group (66%) have no trust in the therapeutic process  
5. 100% of the users from one persona i.e. married women faced issues related to in-laws & are troubled by it.  
6. Some of the users also mentioned the need for testimonials & trustworthy review, which would increase their trust in the process.  
7. Almost all of the users in the sample group (84%) have not used any app or website to assite them in their mental well being.
