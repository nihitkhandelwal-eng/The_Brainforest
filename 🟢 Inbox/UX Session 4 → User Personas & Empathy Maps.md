### Journaling My User Persona

On the basis of pattern discovered in affinity map, I created three user personas.

They are:

1. Affirmative Neelu
2. Skeptical Ankit
3. Curious Saloni

These user personas are created keeping a majority of my users in mind. Creating these personas will guide me in making decisions for my app considering the goals and needs of my users.

These insights will also help me create an empathy map, which would be the last step of the empathizing phase.

### Journaling My Empathy Mapping

I created empathy map for each of my persona, which really helped me pin point some of the pain points & motivations of the user.  
Summarizing my user personas using empathy maps.

- Grant FreelandFormer Contributor I am a BCG senior partner writing on the future of leadership and work
- If nothing else (and, of course, there’s plenty “else”) the global coronavirus pandemic has increased everybody’s stress and anxiety levels, by a lot.
- anxiety, depression and other mental health pathologies are likely exacerbated by the challenges of leadership.
- The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that depression and anxiety alone cost the global economy about $1 trillion a year in lost productivity.
- The need is simple. If you want to get the most out of your talent, their mental health needs to be a priority.
- First, you must treat mental health as seriously as physical health. Just because you don’t see a problem does not mean it’s not there. We’re learning that lesson from the coronavirus struggle.
- tell your own stories, or if you’ve never had such issues, get other senior leaders to tell theirs. I’ve been amazed, as I and other leaders have shared our personal  experiences, how it has legitimized the conversation about mental health, and how employees have then become more willing to take advantage of mental health services.

- Take social determinants into account. Companies need to understand how the social determinants of health may influence the way their products will be adopted and used. During the design process, it’s critical to work closely with a diverse group of people who are experiencing the health problem that the product is intended to address. Treating people as codevelopers rather than as end users is essential to designing a product that meets the needs of those living with disease.

- Unlocking Bionic Care Delivery In this domain, you support telemedicine and other forms of digital health care delivery. Face-to-face contact will remain when patients want or need it, but many routine consultations will take place through laptops and smartphones. BCG estimates that at least $1.6 trillion can be saved globally each year through digital services. One service, which used telemonitoring for patients released from hospitals, generated a 44% reduction in readmissions within 30 days.
