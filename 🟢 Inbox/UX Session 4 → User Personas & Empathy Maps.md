### Journaling My User Persona
On the basis of pattern discovered in affinity map, I created three user personas. 

They are:
1. Affirmative Neelu
2. Skeptical Ankit
3. Curious Saloni

These user personas are created keeping a majority of my users in mind. Creating these personas will guide me in making decisions for my app considering the goals and needs of my users.

These insights will also help me create an empathy map, which would be the last step of the empathizing phase.
