- Interaction design is the design of the interactions b/w users & products
- How the users interact with the interface is governed by the affordance of the element.

### Elements of Interaction Design
1. **Affordance**
	- Affordance defines what actions are possible b/w an interface & a user.
2. **Signifier**
	- Signifiers are signs & signals of what can be done. 
	- These signs tell us about the possible actions, what to do & where to do.

**Discoverability**
- If the user cannot find it, it does not exist.
- It must be made clear, what actions are possible in a IJI in less than a microsecond. For example, labeling icons is a best practice.

**Shadows & Elevations**
- Shadows and elevations when applied to different Ul components like buttons, tabs & cards, signifies that it can be clicked and hence communicates the affordance of these components.
- Affordance of these buttons is signified by bringing elevation to them.


### Common Interactions of UI Design
- Swipe
	- Users can slide elements to complete actions upon passing a threshold
	- Swiping has no signifiers but are most common to switch between tabs, notification bar & clearing opened tabs in a mobile.
- Tap
- Long Press
	- They can reveal additional modes & features, but are not easily discoverable.
	- They don't have any signifiers, so they are hard to detect. Most commonly used in chat applications 
- Double Tap
- Pinch
- Spread
- Press

**Not To Be Done**
- Avoid situations where a single gesture might produce 2 different results

### UX Laws
- **Place important action button within easy reach of the user → Fitts Law**
- Users have a propensity to best remember the first & last items in a series. →  Serial Position Effect.
- A simple idea that more the choices you present to your user, the longer it will take them to reach a decision. →  **Hick's Law**
	- The designer must keep the cognitive load to a minimum
