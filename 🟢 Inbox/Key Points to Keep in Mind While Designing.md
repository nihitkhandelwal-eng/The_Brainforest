This is a list of all the key lessons I learned in UX UI Course. I am documenting them here so that it will be easier for me to keep them at my fingertips.

Always keep the [[UX Session 1 → Introduction to UI & UX Design#Design Thinking|Principles of Design Thinking]] in mind. After that I conducted Interviews, here are the [[UX Session 2 → Conducting User Research#Interview Journal|key findings from those interviews]].

I then did [[UX Session 3 → Research Analysis#Journaling affinity mapping|Affinity Mapping]], created [[UX Session 4 → User Personas & Empathy Maps#Journaling My User Persona|3 User Personas]] & [[UX Session 4 → User Personas & Empathy Maps#Journaling My Empathy Mapping|Empathy Mapping]] 
To wrap the empathize phase, I did [[UX Session 4 → User Personas & Empathy Maps#Actionable Intelligence|secondary research]] & also found about [[UX Session 4 → User Personas & Empathy Maps#Pain Points from Competitors|pain points from other competitor apps]].

We then learned about [[UX Session 5 → Mental Model & User Flows#Mental Models|Mental Models]] which is a **key thing to keep in mind while wireframing.**
I then have my [[UX Session 5 → Mental Model & User Flows#Journaling Customer Journey Map|User Journey Map]] & [[UX Session 5 → Mental Model & User Flows#Journaling User Flow|User Flow]] to keep in mind while designing.

As we stepped into the *ideate* process, key things are coming up, so be alert & aware.
Information Architecture is introduced & with that comes [[UX Session 6 → Information Architecture - Navigation#Navigation in UI Design|Navigation in UI Design]], which if applied can be really helpful.
I have a small [[UX Session 6 → Information Architecture - Navigation#Journaling My Sitemap|sitemap to guide me]] during design process.
