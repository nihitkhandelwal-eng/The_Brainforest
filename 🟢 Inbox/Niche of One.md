It's the place that attracts like minded people, it is really great for personal branding, not necessarily for business.
You really need a niche if you want to offer anything, the idea of "niche of one" is a little bit broader than "niche".

This is basically you building niche around yourself.

### Idea Creator
Somebody who shares ideas. You use one piece of content to share one idea & you try to talk it up & down as best as you can.

The goal/framework that organically ends up happening here is that **you start to occupy the mind of a topic, but no more than 4 topics**


Write down NO MORE than 4 topics that you want to be known for.
1. Rationality
2. Scientific Mindset & Scientific Curiosity
3. PKM
4. Gamification

What are the topics underneath them that make it up?
