It's the place that attracts like minded people, it is really great for personal branding, not necessarily for business.
You really need a niche if you want to offer anything, the idea of "niche of one" is a little bit broader than "niche".

This is basically you building niche around yourself.

### Idea Creator
Somebody who shares ideas. You use one piece of content to share one idea & you try to talk it up & down as best as you can.

The goal/framework that organically ends up happening here is that **you start to occupy the mind of a topic, but no more than 4 topics**

Write down NO MORE than 4 topics that you want to be known for.
What are the topics underneath them that make it up?
Can you make note relationships between them?

1. Rationality
	- Objectivity
	- Progressive Mindset
	- Parenting
	- Evidence Based Thinking
	- Question Everything
	- The Scientific Method
2. Psychology & Psychiatry
	- Mental Health
	- Human Nature
	- Child Psychology
3. PKM
	- Knowledge 
	- Lifelong Learner
	- Thinking
4. Gamification
	- Leveling Up
	- Games for Life
	- How to hack yourself to enjoy what you do?


**Now, can you connect AB, AD or BC, CD & then ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD & eventually ABCD?**

So, what started as [[My Unique Journey]] stems into 4 branches, which then stem out into multiple others & you essentially create a BRAINFOREST

### Anne's Perspective 
- The stem is ABCD & then branches are ACD, ABD, BCD, ABD & so on.
- You will have to go to the top of the tree to figure out what A is.
