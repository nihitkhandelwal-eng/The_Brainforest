Operant conditioning is a form of learning where behaviour is shaped by antecedents (things that come before)
and consequences (things that come after).

| Antecendent                                                  | Behaviour                        | Consequence                                                                                 | Interpretation |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Parents talking to each other & not paying attention to baby | Baby drops pacifier on the floor | Mother pays attention to baby. She smiles & says "did you drop your pacifier?". Baby Smiles | From the baby's point of view, dropping the pacifier led to a reward (more positive attention from mother) & reinforces that behaviour (makes it more likely in the future)               |

The key principles of operant conditioning are that **reward** & **punishment** change subsequent behaviour.


#### **Reinforcement** makes a behaviour more likely
-  Positive Reinforcement
	- Behaviour is followed by a reward
	- You eat some ice-cream, it tastes good & you enjoy it, so you eat some more.
	- Client behaves disruptively & is given more one-to-one attention
	- Child has a reward chart for good behaviour
- Negative Reinforcement
	- Behaviour leads to removal of an unwanted of stimulus
	- The sun has been getting in your eyes & you put sunglasses on. It feels like a relief.
	- Anxious client avoids a situation which makes them anxious & feels relief.
	- Client with an eating disorder vomits delibrately & feels less full.
	- 


#### Punishment makes a behaviour less likely
- Punishment
	- Behaviour is followed by an unpleasant stimulus. 
	- Cat has been goinq to the toilet in your garden so you make a loud noise to scare it away
	- Punishment is not commonly used in clinical settings. It was called aversion therapy and was widely used in the past. It is now sometimes used to treat alcohol abuse.
- Penalty
	- Behaviour is followed by the removal of a desired stimulus. 
	- Child has been naughty and is grounded.
	- Therapists may ignore (or refrain from reacting to) certain client behaviours â€” the intended effect is to shape the conversation in a more productive direction. This is often explicitly agreed bettween client and therapist.
