# Projects MOC
There are excellent ways to manage projects and tasks with linked frameworks. 

However, the LYT opinion is that most projects need *less* maintenance work, not more. Don't micro-manage yourself. Keep it spartan. Give yourself a broad direction and let your own ingenuity surprise you.

My projects are a bit too private to share publicly in the LYT Kit. So this is just a placeholder note for you to work with.

As for me, I'm going to go to [[LYT Project Scopes ðŸ”¬]].

Or, I might dust of [[ToDo]] and attempt some other lightweight experiment. But that won't last long. While everyone is different, I have found that I really don't like polluting my note-making space with tasks and todos that lose their value to me in the weeks, months, and years to come.

While "projects" and "makings" overlap substantially, I find an unrelenting need to maintain a distinctionâ€”and a spaceâ€”to allow writings and works to grow without the shadow of a "project" looming over them. Go to the [[Makings MOC]] to enter that space.
