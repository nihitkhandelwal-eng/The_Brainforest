### Release notes for LYT v5 alpha - 2021-03
- 226 Notes
- Refined Home note
- Thinking about taking away the numbers on my top ten MOCs because some people get really caught up thinking they have to number everything. Don't. Number. Everything.
- Took away the Calendar MOC because: I didn't use it, other people got the wrong ideas about it, and frankly, the "Calendar" plugin is wonderful.
- Shifted Back Matter to Front Matter, and hid a lot of the Front Matter to keep control over the story being told. (Note: YAML functionality isn't quite there yet, but ask me again in a few months!)
- For those wondering, this theme that I love so dearly is called the [[Cybertron Theme]].
- Hidden easter eggs in the forest
