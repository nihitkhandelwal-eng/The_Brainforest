- [ ] Write it in more detail as the [[LYT Workshop 8]] progresses on #action/✔todo 

### Action
#action 
- Actionable things I can do on a note
- #action/✔todo is straightforward but this will evolve once I explore [[Plugin Exploration#^b3d766|Task Based Plugins]] 
- #action/🃏ankify is for anything which needs to be added to anki
- #action/📰to-translate is primarily for music pieces whose translation I need to add.
- I am yet to think about #action/❓question | #action/📌put-a-pin-on-that  | #action/🧹tidy 


### Excalidraw
#excalidraw 
- Every excalidraw file is tagged with `#excalidraw`
- All blank excalidraw files i.e. potential drawings are tagged with #excalidraw/🧻blank 
- Every idea that I have expressed in excalidraw is tagged with #excalidraw/🖊sketch 

### Journal
 #journal
 - The tag `#journal` in itself is not something I have used yet, might use it later at some point
 - #journal/highlight is used when I want to highlight any daily note on the calendar with a star
 - Journal tags based on primary feel of the day
	 - #journal/happy → #journal/funny | #journal/proud | #journal/confident | #journal/optimistic | #journal/creative
	- #journal/surprised → #journal/intentional | #journal/focussed | #journal/energized | #journal/productive
	- #journal/procrastinating → #journal/anxious | #journal/sick | #journal/discouraged | #journal/lonely | #journal/disappointed
	- #journal/bad → #journal/depressed | #journal/numb | #journal/devastated | #journal/furious | #journal/terrified
	- #journal/euphoric → #journal/musical


### Placeholder
#placeholder
- I have a lot of placeholder tags, this will be sorted out once the [[LYT Workshop 8]] is done

### Status
#status
- This needs to be written well
- I will be making changes as the workshop progresses on
- Right now, I have created the tags #status/1️⃣stage-0 , #status/1️⃣stage-1 & #status/1️⃣stage-2 
	- `#status/1️⃣stage-0` will be for inbox items 
	- `#status/1️⃣stage-1` will be added to all
	- If the note is mature, I will replace it with `#status/1️⃣stage-2` 
	- For now, this will be it
- I have other tags like #status/🌲evergreen | #status/🍃boat | #status/💭think | #status/🔓opinion     
	- Opinion is something that I have little knowledge about & I am actively looking for knowledge in that topic


### Type
#type 
- These are relatively straightforward & won't change much
- #type/⌘MOC  will be added for MOC's
- #type/🎬entertainment is a generic tag for everything entertainment, it is further divided into → #type/🎬entertainment/🎥show  | #type/🎬entertainment/📽movie
	- These will be added to any movie/show reference
- #type/🎯goal is for goal management
	- I have categorized them into #type/🎯goal/low_priority | #type/🎯goal/medium_priority  | #type/🎯goal/mission_critical  | #type/🎯goal/up_next 
- #type/🎵music is a generic tag for everything music, it is further divided into → #type/🎵music/🎶poem | #type/🎵music/🎧qawwali 
	- #type/🎵music/📄translated is more of a tracker tag for pieces of music that have been translated 
- #type/👤people is everything people & right now it only has #type/👤people/😍family & #type/👤people/😎friend 
- #type/📚book is everything book related
- #type/🕸web_clipping is automatically applied to anything saved from the web from the clipper or [[Windows Hotkeys#^61b5f5|markdownload extension]] 
- #type/🗯quote is for quotes. Let's see if I start liking them
- #type/🚸admin is for anything obsidian, marvin & notion related, i.e. me managing my systems
