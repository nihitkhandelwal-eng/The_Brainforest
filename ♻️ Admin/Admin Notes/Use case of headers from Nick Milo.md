# Here is my H1 header

Then I prefer jumping into H3 headers. 

### Here's an H3 header
These are my workhorse headers. I use H3 headers the most.

#### Here's an H4 header to make a subpoint
I usually don't have much of a need to go below H4.

### Why H3 header's?
I prefer H3 headers because they give me flexibility to break up longer notes. How?

## H2 Headers break up longer notes
Sometimes my notes are long, and that's where I keep the H2 header in my back pocket, ready to wield when needed to break up my work.
