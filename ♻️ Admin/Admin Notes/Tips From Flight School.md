## Note taking Tips
### H1 | H2 & H3

Q: Should I use an H1 header in my note?
- it is aesthetically pleasing
- it is consistent, both for you and others
- having an H1 header is a standard best practice (and is good for SEO)

Q. Should I always go from H1 to H2?
A. No. While going from H1 to H2 to H3 is better for SEO than skipping H2, you need to give yourself flexibility during the thinking/writing process.


Q. Why? I already know what I want to say.
A. Well, if you already know what you are going to say, then sure, go in order: H1, H2, then H3. But the truth is, you often don't know what you are going to say, and trying to impose a rigid top-down structure too early will take away your ability to think as creatively.


Q. How long should a note be?
A. Do you want a clear answer, even if it is riddled with more holes than swiss cheese? Fine. A note should be less than 333 words. 333 words will be visible on screen all at one time (usually). So that's a good rule of thumb.


But seriously, some notes will be long and some will be short. This note could easily be broken up into 4 different notes. Why didn't I do that? Because over-structuring too soon is a trap, and it's a best practice of mine to avoid falling into unnecessary structuring traps. It should be for you too.

If I was using H3's then I can stay loose and creative (not restricted) as I come up with things to think/write about. Then, near the end of my session, I can make a quick pass and easily add any structure that has revealed itself.

At the end of this process, you still have your proper H1, H2, and H3 headers, but you developed your structure in a fluid, non-rigid way, allowing your creative, lateral thinking muscles to stay involved in the work.

### H6
- Header 6 is when you want a header, but not really.
- Header 6 is the swiss army knife of using a header without messing around with the core structure of the note (nor with messing around with SEO).

### On the use of dividers
Just like the "exploratory" approach to headers, I use dividers in much the same way. I use dividers liberally the start with, sometimes whenever something just "feels" different enough. A good example of this is when I take meeting notes. I don't want to add a ton of headers in the moment; it feels too heavy. Instead, I'll just add a divider and keep typing.
Also, if you want to give a presentation using Obsidian, the core "slides" plugin uses dividers to recognize page breaks.
### On the use of bold and italics
I am an advocate of having bold and italics actually stand out. If it blends in and is barely visible, then why even have it? In general, both formats are intended to emphasize text. My rule of thumb is this:

Use italics to emphasize phrases
Use bold to emphasize things (concepts, people, places, things...nouns)
