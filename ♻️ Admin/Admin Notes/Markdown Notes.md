# Lists
Ordered Lists → use 1. 
bullet lists → use - 

# Links
### External Links
1. <mark class='red' >Simple links can be done by just pasting</mark> 
2. Alias can be done by inserting text [Here](Link here)

### Internal Links
1. Simple one is known to all
2. Alias → Create a normal link but after the name, within the bracket itself, add a | & anything after that is now an alias for that thing.

### Embedding
1. Internal note embedding → use ! before the link
2. Block embedding → similar to normal embedding but after the name of the note, type # to look for headings in that note or type ^ to look for blocks in that note & they will be embedded
3. If you want to look for block references across the vault, type ^^ in the square brackets
4. You can embed audio, video, image any file 

# Quotes
Use >
> Everybody Lies
\- House

> Everybody Lies

# Code Blocks
1. Code block  →  Specify language in the top & write.
	Use `to create inline code`

# Foot Notes
The simple way to do this is by adding foot notes within one square brackets by typing ^ & then manually recreating the same thing at the bottom to reference it like[^3] 

I also have a plugin enabled for this so lets say that I want to cite a source here[^1]

[^2]: this is seamless
[^3]: This is actually seamless & it is adding foot notes to the bottom
