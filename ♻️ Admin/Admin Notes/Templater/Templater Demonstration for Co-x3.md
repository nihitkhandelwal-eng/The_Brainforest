Here is a quick intro to templates

-   Templates by definition allows you to get a pre-determined content into your notes, much like Notion.
-   So, if you want a section of your notes to have certain headings, you could just create a template & use it instead of writing it every time.
	- To demonstrate this, lets look at my daily notes template
-   The most basic use could be like a text expander, so if I have to write anything again & again, I would create a shortcut for it, like my home address, email address, a formal note etc.
-  If I want to insert a sticky note, I have a CSS Snippet which allows me to do that so I will now use my "insert template" hotkey, which is Alt+E in my case
	- <div class="sticky">this is a sticky note</div> 



	- The "tp.cursor" thing is how you can quickly move your cursor to the desired field by a hotkey which you can modify
		- I have set it to "Alt+Enter"

Most of the basic stuff can be done without the templater plugin.

But it is one of the best plugin & you should use it for advanced use cases.
- For this, you will have to download the plugin & set a template folder, you can create as many subfolders under that one folder, it doesn't matter, any file in the main template folder is recognized as template by the plugin

### How I use templates & my use cases
- I have 3 main categories
- The first is components, which are just basic snippets to do one action only, like superscript, subscript, embedding media, some of them are there because I have CSS Snippets which allow me to do certain things like move a text aside
	- <s class="aside-hide">This will be hidden</s> This is a statement & I have a comment about it 
- The next is Input type of templates
	- I use a template called "-Meta" to insert all these template & then move certain notes to a certain folder, all this is done using templater
- last group is journal related 
	- so my daily notes template will be linked to that week's template, the weekly note will then be linked to that month & so on
	- this is not dependent on when the note is created, so if I create the note for 3rd March 2022 today, it will still work

This are the basics, play around with the templates & throw any questions that you might have
