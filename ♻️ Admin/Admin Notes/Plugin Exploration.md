title: "Relation Map plugin"
description: "Probably this was proposed before, but I wanted to share an implementation that I found in trillium:       To have this in Obsidian would be helpful to organize thoughts using small graphs ( < 25 nodes).  I think the nodes can (should) be the notes themselves that we drag into the canvas. We can refactor them visually; for example, if we rename a note in Obsidian, this should also be renamed in the diagram. Perhaps this can be extended to draw groups or connect MOCs instead of just notes"
