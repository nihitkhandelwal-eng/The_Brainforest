# EMERGENCE  LEVEL Collecting from the primordial idea 

soup (sources, ideas, interactions, insights).



New ideas solidify into unique notes.

DIVERGENCE
From the collection and extraction phase, new ideas solidy into unique shapes.

MAKING ATOMIC NOTES
Here’s a basic Zettelkasten of atomic notes without links yet.



Some are placeholders, some half-formed.  



These are ideas without structure.

# 2

# EMERGENCE  LEVEL Direct links only. No higher-order 

notes have yet been created.



![LYTIdeaEmergence–Onefullimage_1_651](Generated/images/LYTIdeaEmergence–Onefullimage_1_651.png)

This is a living system naturally evolving.


GROWING NOTE LIBRARY
As a note library grows, it can become difficult to navigate quickly, even with excellent direct links between notes. 



The perspective is at sea level.

LINKING ATOMIC NOTES
Here’s a more connected Zettelkasten showing some atomic notes with bi-directional links.



Some better built notes are starting to become evergreen.

DIVERGENCE, EMERGENCE, AND CONVERGENCE
Some divergence, convergence, and emergence happens naturally here, but there is not a clear perspective.

# 3

# EMERGENCE  LEVEL Higher order notes like MOCs are 

being assembled, collided, and unified.



EMERGENCE
Emergence is when the new whole is greater than the sum of its parts.



Each note is refined and has settled into a natural spatial constellation.



CONVERGENCE + DIVERGENCE
Convergence continues but conflict causes new divergence.



![LYTIdeaEmergence–Onefullimage_1_3042](Generated/images/LYTIdeaEmergence–Onefullimage_1_3042.png)

CONVERGENCE
Similar ideas are put in close proximity. It’s natural that they gather into spatial relationships

<sup>Massive amounts of convergence, divergence, and emergence happen here.</sup>

# EMERGENCE  LEVEL Linking Higher-order notes.

EMERGENCE


Higher order notes are connecting to each other.

These are living Eco-systems of thought.

# EMERGENCE  LEVEL Consolidating the new higher 

order notes with the old higher order notes.



TOP-DOWN CONVERGENCE
The Home note allows for top-down “Convergent” thinking like navigating and deliberate creating.



BOTTOM-UP CONVERGENCE
The Home note allows for bottom-up “Convergent” thinking by consolidating new forms of emergence.

All roads lead to home.



UNIFYING PHASE
- Merge/Unify
- Navigate
-Reference



What emerges is a valuable grouping of ideas. Two obvious benefits: It can be used to navigate your notes and to create a final product.

COLLIDING PHASE
-Interact
-Exchange
- Collide



Thought collisions produce insights. Colliding ideas in higher order notes can raise our thinking abilities to another level. This is what we mean by “next level thinking.”

ASSEMBLING PHASE
-Gather
- Assemble
-Incubate



It’s helpful to get a higher-level perspective on your notes. Any “Note about notes” is a higher order note. It will mainly have links to other notes.

HIGHER-ORDER NOTES
Your new higher order note links to your existing web of higher-order notes.



A rule of thumb is that all roads should lead to Home. That means all higher order notes should lead to your Home note.

CREATION
Creating new stuff becomes mostly effortless because the majority of the work was already done. 



Just apply it to your specific purpose, do a bit of specific assembling, fill in the gaps, and presto!

THE HOME NOTE
The Home note is the beginning and the end. It is a launchpad and a homebase. It is a North Star.



It is a spot to deliberately create. It is a spot to consciously consolidate.

HOME MAPS
These “Home Maps” are special higher-order notes that emerge over time.



Since you weren’t born yesterday you may already have some ideas for your top-level “Home Maps.”



But since you are just putting this together, add less than you want and let the rest emerge organically as they are needed. Too much too soon is too bad.
