                                                    USING   THIS  BOOK 

This work is intended as a review for students during their preclinical years and while preparing 
for examinations, such as the             To this effect, the organization of this book follows that 
of most primary texts in the field and parallels the syllabus used in pathophysiology courses in 
medical schools throughout the United States. Ample space is provided for students to make 
notes during course study and while viewing the online videos that cover each section of the 
text (www.pathoma.com). 
     We recommend that students use Fundamentals of Pathology during their medical courses, 
taking notes in the margin as pertinent topics are covered. When exam time comes around, 
these notes will likely be invaluable. 
     For examination preparation, we suggest students read the material first, then listen to the 
online lecture, and then reread the material to develop a solid grasp of each topic. One should 
not become disheartened if they are not able to retain all the information contained herein. 
This deceptively slim volume covers a tremendous amount of material, and repetition will be a 
key aid as you progress in your studies. 
     An effort  has been made to emphasize concepts and principles over random facts, the 
forest rather than the trees. Attention to the same by the student will provide a deeper, more 
meaningful understanding of human disease. We must always remind ourselves that ultimately 
our goal is to learn, to share, and to serve. Fundamentals of Pathology was developed with this 
goal in mind. 
                                                                                                Husain A. Sattar, MD 
                                                                                                Chicago, Illinois

This work would  not have been possible without the support and encouragement of those 
around me. To begin with, I would like to acknowledge Shaykh Zulfiqar Ahmad, whose clear 
vision has guided me to horizons I would never have known. My family is to be acknowledged 
for their limitless sacrifice, in particular the constant encouragement and support of my wife 
Amina, who has proved through the years to be the wind under my wings. Thomas Krausz, 
MD and Aliya Husain, MD (both Professors of Pathology at the University of Chicago) deserve 
particular mention for  their valuable advice and guiding vision, both in the development of 
this book as well as my career. Special thanks to the multiple reviewers at medical centers 
throughout the country for their critical comments, in particular Mir Basharath Alikhan, MD 
(Pathology resident, University of Chicago) and Joshua T.B. Williams (Class of 2013, Pritzker 
School of Medicine, University of Chicago) for their extensive review. Olaf Nelson (Chinook 
Design, Inc.) is to be commended for his excellent layout and design. Finally, I would be remiss 
without acknowledging my students, who give meaning to what I do.

                                      GROWTH ADAPTATIONS 

,   BASIC PRINCIPLES 
    A.  An organ is in homeostasis with the physiologic stress placed on it. 
    B.  An increase, decrease, or change in stress on an organ can result in growth 
         adaptations. 

,,   HYPERPLASIA AND HYPERTROPHY 
    A.  An increase in stress leads to an increase in organ size. 
          O   Occurs via an increase in the size (hypertrophy) and/or the number 
              (hyperplasia) of cells 
    B.  Hypertrophy involves gene activation, protein synthesis, and production of 
         organelles. 
     C. Hyperplasia involves the production of new cells from stem cells. 
     D. Hyperplasia and hypertrophy generally occur together (e.g., uterus during 
         pregnancy). 
          O   Permanent tissues (e .g., cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and nerve), however, 
              cannot make new cells and undergo hypertrophy only. 
         2.  For example, cardiac myocytes undergo hypertrophy, not hyperplasia, in 
              response to systemic hypertension (Fig. 1.1) . 
     E. Pathologic hyperplasia (e.g., endometrial hyperplasia) can progress to dysplasia and, 
         eventually, cancer. 
          1. A notable exception is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which does not 
              increase the risk for prostate cancer. 

,,,  ATROPHY 
     A. A decrease in stress (e.g., decreased hormonal stimulation, disuse, or decreased 
          nutrients/blood supply) leads to a decrease in organ size (atrophy). 
          O   Occurs via a decrease in the size and number of cells 
     B. Decrease in cell number occurs via apoptosis. 
     C. Decrease in cell size occurs via ubiquitin-proteosome degradation of the 
         cytoskeleton and autophagy of cellular components. 
          O   In ubiquitin-proteosome degradation, intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton 
              are "tagged" with ubiquitin and destroyed by proteosomes. 
          2. Autophagy of cellular components involves generation of autophagic vacuoles. 
              These vacuoles fuse with lysosomes whose hydrolytic enzymes breakdown 
              cellular components. 


IV. METAPLASIA 
     A. A change in stress on an organ leads to a change in cell type (metaplasia). 
          1. Most commonly involves change of one type of surface epithelium (squamous, 
              columnar, or urothelial) to another 
          2. Metaplastic cells are better able to handle the new stress. 
     B. Barrett esophagus is a classic example.

           1.  Esophagus is normally lined by nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium (suited to 
                handle friction  of a food bolus). 
           2.  Acid  reflux from the stomach causes metaplasia to nonciliated, mucin-producing 
                columnar cells (better able to handle the stress of acid, Fig. 1.2). 
     &   Metaplasia occurs via reprogramming of stem cells, which then produce the new cell 
           type. 
           1.  Metaplasia is reversible, in theory, with removal of the driving stressor. 
           2.  For example, treatment of gastroesophageal reflux may reverse Barrett 
                esophagus. 
     D.  Under persistent stress, metaplasia can progress to dysplasia and eventually result in 
           cancer. 
           1.   For example, Barrett esophagus may progress to adenocarcinoma of the 
                 esophagus. 
           2.   A notable exception is apocrine metaplasia of breast, which carries no increased 
                 risk for cancer. 
     E.  Vitamin  A deficiency can also result in metaplasia. 
           1.  Vitamin  A  is necessary for differentiation of specialized epithelial surfaces such 
                 as the conjunctiva covering the eye. 
           2.   In vitamin  A deficiency, the thin squamous lining of the conjunctiva undergoes 
                 metaplasia into stratified keratinizing squamous epithelium. This change is 
                 called keratomalacia (Fig. 1.3). 
     )   Mesenchymal  (connective) tissues can also undergo metaplasia. 
           1.   A classic example is myositis ossificans in which muscle tissue changes to bone 
                 during healing after trauma (Fig. 1.4). 


V.  DYSPLASIA 
     A.   Disordered cellular growth 
     B.   Most often refers to proliferation of precancerous cells 
           1.   For example, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) represents dysplasia and is 
                 a precursor to cervical cancer. 
     &   Often arises from longstanding pathologic hyperplasia (e.g., endometrial 
           hyperplasia) or metaplasia (e.g. , Barrett esophagus) 
     D.  Dysplasia is reversible, in theory, with alleviation of inciting stress. 
           1.   If stress persists, dysplasia progresses to carcinoma (irreversible). 


VI. APLASIA  AND  HYPOPLASIA 
     A.   Aplasia is failure of cell production during embryogenesis (e.g., unilateral renal 
           agenesis). 
     %   Hypoplasia is a decrease in cell production during embryogenesis, resulting in a 
           relatively small organ (e .g., streak ovary in Turner syndrome).

                     Growth   Adaptations,   Cellular              and  Cell Death 


                                                 CELLULAR  INJURY 

,   BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A.  Cellular injury occurs when a stress exceeds the cell's ability to adapt. 
     B.  The likelihood of injury depends on the type of stress, its severity, and the type of 
          cell affected. 
           O   Neurons are highly susceptible to ischemic injury; whereas, skeletal muscle is 
                relatively more resistant. 
          2.   Slowly developing ischemia (e.g., renal artery atherosclerosis) results in atrophy; 
                whereas, acute ischemia (e.g. , renal artery embolus) results in injury. 
     C.  Common causes of cellular injury include inflammation, nutritional deficiency or 
          excess, hypoxia, trauma, and genetic mutations. 


,,   HYPOXIA 
     A.  Low oxygen delivery to tissue; important cause of cellular injury 
           O   Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain of oxidative 
                phosphorylation. 
           2.  Decreased oxygen impairs oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in decreased 
                ATP production. 
          3.   Lack of ATP (essential energy source) leads to cellular injury. 
     B.  Causes of hypoxia include ischemia, hypoxemia, and decreased 0 2-carrying capacity 
          of blood. 
     C.  Ischemia is decreased blood flow through an organ. Arises with 
           O   Decreased arterial perfusion (e.g., atherosclerosis) 
           2.  Decreased venous drainage (e.g., Budd-Chiari syndrome) 
           3.  Shock-generalized hypotension resulting in poor tissue perfusion 
                                                                                                            60 mm Hg, Sao
     D.  Hypoxemia is a low partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (Pao2                2 
             90%). Arises with 
           O   High altitude- Decreased barometric pressure results in decreased PAo2. 
           2.  Hypoventilation- Increased PAC02 results in decreased PA02 
           3.  Diffusion defect-PAo2 not able to push as much  2 into the blood due to a 
                thicker diffusion barrier (e.g., interstitial pulmonary fibrosis) 
           4.  V/Q mismatch-Blood bypasses oxygenated lung (circulation problem, e.g., 
                right-to-left shunt), or oxygenated air cannot reach blood (ventilation problem, 
                e.g., atelectasis). 
     E.  Decreased 0 2-carrying capacity arises with hemoglobin (Hb) loss or dysfunction. 
           Examples include 
                                                                         normal; Sao normal 
           O   Anemia (decrease in RBC mass)- Pao2           2 
           2.  Carbon monoxide poisoning

                                                                      iii.  Classic finding is cherry-red appearance of skin.

                                                                           death. 
                                                                3.   Methemoglobinemia 
                                                                      i.    Iron in heme is oxidized to Fe'+, which cannot bind oxygen-Pao2 normal; 
                                                                            Sao, decreased 
                                                                      ii.   Seen with oxidant stress (e.g., sulfa and nitrate drugs) or in newborns 
                                                                      iii . Classic finding is cyanosis with chocolate-colored blood. 
                                                                      iv.  Treatment is intravenous methylene blue, which helps reduce Fe' + back to 
                                                                            Fe2+ state. 


                                                     III.  REVERSIBLE AND  IRREVERSIBLE  CELLULAR  INJURY 
                                                          A.   Hypoxia impairs oxidative phosphorylation resulting in  decreased ATP. 
                                                           B.  Low ATP disrupts key cellular functions including 
                                                                O   Na+- K+ pump, resulting in sodium and water buildup in the cell 
                                                                2.   Ca2+ pump, resulting in Ca2+ buildup in the cytosol of the cell 
                                                                3.   Aerobic glycolysis, resulting in a switch to anaerobic glycolysis. Lactic acid

                                                          C.   The initial phase of injury is reversible. The hallmark of reversible injury is cellular 
                                                                swelling. 
                                                                1.   Cytosol swelling results in loss of microvilli and membrane blebbing. 
                                                                2.   Swelling of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) results in dissociation of 
                                                                      ribosomes and decreased protein synthesis. 
                                                           D.  Eventually, the damage becomes irreversible. The hallmark of irreversible injury is 
                                                                membrane damage. 
                                                                1.   Plasma membrane damage results in

                                                                      ii.   Additional  calcium entering into the cell

                                                             CELL   DEATH 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
      A.  The morphologic  hallmark  of  cell death is loss of the nucleus, which occurs via 
            nuclear condensation (pyknosis),  fragmentation  (karyorrhexis),  and  dissolution 
            (karyolysis). 
      B.  The two mechanisms  of cell death are necrosis and apoptosis. 


II.   NECROSIS 
      A.  Death of  large groups of cells followed by acute inflammation 
      B.  Due to  some underlying  pathologic process; never physiologic 
      &   Divided  into  several types based on gross features 


III.  GROSS PATTERNS  OF NECROSIS 
      A.  Coagulative  necrosis 
            l.    Necrotic  tissue that remains firm  (Fig.  l.SA); cell shape and organ structure  are 
                  preserved by coagulation of proteins,  but the nucleus disappears (Fig.  l.SB) . 
            2.   Characteristic  of ischemic infarction   of any organ except the brain 
            3.   Area of infarcted  tissue is often wedge-shaped (pointing  to focus of vascular 
                  occlusion) and pale. 
            4.   Red infarction  arises if blood  re-enters a loosely organized tissue (e .g., 
                  pulmonary  or  testicular infarction,   Fig. 1.6). 
      B.  Liquefactive  necrosis 
            l.    Necrotic  tissue that becomes liquefied; enzymatic  lysis of cells and protein  results 
                  in liquefaction. 
            2.   Characteristic  of 
                  i.    Brain  infarction-Proteolytic      enzymes from  microglial  cells liquefy  the 
                        brain. 
                  ii .  Abscess-Proteolytic    enzymes from  neutrophils  liquefy  tissue. 
                  iii.   Pancreatitis- Proteolytic    enzymes from pancreas liquefy  parenchyma. 
      C.  Gangrenous necrosis 
            l.    Coagulative  necrosis that resembles mummified  tissue (dry gangrene, Fig. 1.7) 
            2.   Characteristic  of ischemia of lower  limb  and GI tract 
            3.   ,I superimposed  infection  of dead tissues occurs, then liquefactive  necrosis 
                  ensues (wet gangrene). 
      D.  Caseous necrosis 
            l.    Soft and friable  necrotic tissue with  "cottage cheese-like"  appearance (Fig. 1.8) 
            2.   Combination  of  coagulative and liquefactive  necrosis 
            3.   Characteristic  of granulomatous  inflammation   due to tuberculous  or fungal 
                  infection

                                                                      calcium (Fig. 1.9) 
                                                                2.   Characteristic of trauma to fat (e.g., breast) and pancreatitis-mediated damage of 
                                                                      peripancreatic fat 
                                                                3.   Fatty acids released by trauma (e.g., to breast) or lipase (e .g., pancreatitis) join 
                                                                     with  calcium via a process called saponification. 
                                                                      L   Saponification is an example of dystrophic calcification in which calcium 
                                                                           deposits on dead tissues. In dystrophic calcification, the necrotic tissue 
                                                                           acts as a nidus for calcification in the setting of normal serum calcium and 
                                                                           phosphate. 
                                                                      ii.   Dystrophic calcification is distinct from  metastatic calcification, in which 
                                                                           high serum calcium or phosphate levels lead to calcium deposition in normal 
                                                                            tissues (e.g., hyperparathyroidism leading to nephrocalcinosis).

                                                                2.   Leaking of proteins (including fibrin)  into vessel wall results in bright pink 
                                                                      staining of the wall microscopically (Fig. 1.10). 
                                                                3.   Characteristic of malignant hypertension and vasculitis

                                                          A.   Energy (ATP)-dependent, genetically programmed cell death involving single cells 
                                                                or small groups of cells. Examples include 
                                                                1.   Endometrial shedding during menstrual cycle 
                                                                2.   Removal of cells during embryogenesis 
                                                                3.   CDS+ T cell-mediated killing of virally infected cells 
                                                           B.  Morphology 
                                                                1.   Dying cell shrinks, leading cytoplasm to become more eosinophilic (pink, Fig. 1.11). 
                                                                2.   Nucleus condenses (pyknosis) and fragments (karyorrhexis).

                                                  FREE   RADICAL      INJURY 

I.    BASIC  PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Free radicals are chemical species with  an unpaired  electron in  their  outer orbit. 
     %   Physiologic  generation of free radicals  occurs during  oxidative  phosphorylation. 
            1.   Cytochrome  c oxidase (complex IV)  transfers electrons  to oxygen. 
            2.   Partial  reduction  of02  yields superoxide (0),    hydrogen peroxide  (Hp2),   and 
                  hydroxyl  radicals ("OH). 
      C.  Pathologic  generation of free radicals  arises with 
            1.   Ionizing  radiation- water    hydrolyzed  to hydroxyl  free radical 
            2.   Inflammation-NADPH       oxidase generates superoxide ions during  oxygen-
                  dependent killing   by neutrophils. 
            3.   Metals (e.g., copper and iron)-Fe2+  generates hydroxyl  free radicals (Fenton 
                  reaction). 
            4.   Drugs and chemicals-P450    system ofliver  metabolizes  drugs (e.g., 
                  acetaminophen), generating  free radicals. 
      D.  Free radicals cause cellular injury   via peroxidation  oflipids   and oxidation   of DNA 
            and proteins; DNA  damage is implicated  in  aging and oncogenesis. 
      E.  Elimination   of  free radicals occurs via  multiple  mechanisms. 
            1.   Antioxidants   (e .g., glutathione and vitamins  A,  C, and E) 
            2.   Enzymes 
                  i.    Superoxide dismutase (in  mitochondria)-Superoxide             -*   Hp2 
                  ii.   Glutathione  peroxidase  (in mitochondria)-GSH      +free  radical-*    GSSH and 
                        Hp 
                                                                                         and H 0 
                  iii.  Catalase (in  peroxisomes)-H20 2 -*    0 2          2
            3.   Metal carrier  proteins  (e .g., transferrin and ceruloplasmin) 


II.   FREE RADICAL    INJURY 
      A.  Carbon  tetrachloride  (CCI4) 

            1.   Organic solvent  used in the dry  cleaning industry 
                                                 free radical  by P450 system of hepatocytes 
            2.   Converted to  CCI3 
            3.   Results in cell injury   with  swelling of  RER; consequently, ribosomes detach, 
                  impairing   protein synthesis. 
            4.   Decreased apolipoproteins  lead to fatty change in  the liver  (Fig. 1.12). 
      B.  Reperfusion  injury 
            1.   Return of  blood to ischemic  tissue results in production   of02-derived   free 
                  radicals, which  further  damage tissue.

                                                                2.   Restrictive cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia 
                                                                3.   Tongue enlargement, malabsorption, and hepatosplenomegaly 
                                                           D.  Diagnosis requires tissue biopsy. Abdominal fat pad and rectum are easily accessible 
                                                                biopsy targets. 
                                                           E.  Damaged organs must be transplanted. Amyloid cannot be removed.

                                              INTRODUCTION 
,   INFLAMMATION 
    A.  Allows inflammatory cells, plasma proteins (e .g., complement), and fluid to exit 
         blood vessels and enter the interstitial space 
    B.  Divided into acute and chronic inflammation 


                                       ACUTE INFLAMMATION 
,   BASIC PRINCIPLES 
    A.  Characterized by the presence of edema and neutrophils in tissue (Fig. 2.1A) 
    B.  Arises in response to infection (to eliminate pathogen) or tissue necrosis (to clear 
         necrotic debris) 
    C.  Immediate response with limited specificity (innate immunity) 

,,   MEDIATORS OF ACUTE INFLAMMATION 
    A.  Toll -like receptors (TLRs) 
         O   Present on cells of the innate immune system (e .g., macrophages and dendritic 
              cells) 
         2.  Activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are 
              commonly shared by microbes 
              i.   CD14 (a TLR) on macrophages recognizes lipopolysaccharide (a PAMP) on 
                   the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. 
         3.  TLR activation results in upregulation ofNF-KB, a nuclear transcription factor 
              that activates immune response genes leading to production of multiple immune 
              mediators. 
         4.  TLRs are also present on cells of adaptive immunity (e.g., lymphocytes) and, 
              hence, play an important role in mediating chronic inflammation. 
     B. Arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites 
          O   AA is released from the phospholipid cell membrane by phospholipase A2 and 
              then acted upon by cyclooxygenase or 5-lipoxygenase. 
              i.   Cyclooxygenase produces prostaglandins (PG). 
                                                      mediate vasodilation and increased vascular 
                   a.  PGI2, PGD2, and PGE2 
                        permeability. 
                   b.  PGE2 also mediates pain. 
              ii.  5-lipoxygenase produces leukotrienes (LT). 
                   a.  LTB4 attracts and activates neutrophils. 
                                                     (slow reacting substances of anaphylaxis) mediate 
                   b.  LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 
                        vasoconstriction, bronchospasm, and increased vascular permeability. 
     C. Mast cells 
          O   Widely distributed throughout connective tissue 
         2.  Activated by (l) tissue trauma, (2) complement proteins C3a and C5a, or (3) 
              cross-linking of cell-surface IgE by antigen 

19
                i.    Immediate response involves release of preformed histamine granules, which 
                      mediate vasodilation of arterioles and increased vascular permeability. 
                ii.   Delayed response involves production of arachidonic acid metabolites, 
                      particularly  leukotrienes. 
     D.  Complement 
           O   Proinflammatory serum proteins that "complement" inflammation 
           2.  Circulate as inactive precursors; activation occurs via 
                i.    Classical pathway-CI   binds IgG or IgM that is bound to antigen. 
                 ii.   Alternative pathway-Microbial   products directly activate complement. 
                 iii.  Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) pathway-MEL   binds to man nose on 
                      microorganisms and activates complement. 
           3.  All  pathways result in production of C3 convertase (mediates C3 --+ C3a and 
                 C3b), which, in turn, produces CS convertase (mediates CS--+ CSa and CSb). CSb 
                 complexes with C6-C9 to form the membrane attack complex (MAC). 
                 i.   C3a and CSa (anaphylatoxins)-trigger mast cell degranulation, resulting in 
                      histamine-mediated vasodilation and increased vascular permeability 
                 ii.   CSa-chemotactic for  neutrophils 
                 iii.  C3b-opsonin   for phagocytosis 
                 iv.  MAC-lyses  microbes by creating a hole in the cell membrane 
     E.   Hageman factor (Factor XII) 
           O   Inactive proinflammatory protein  produced in liver 
           2.   Activated upon exposure to subendothelial or tissue collagen; in turn, activates 
                 i.    Coagulation and fibrinolytic systems 
                 ii.   Complement 
                 iii.  Kinin  system-Kinin   cleaves high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) 
                      to bradykinin,  which mediates vasodilation and increased vascular 
                      permeability  (similar to histamine), as well as pain. 


,,,  CARDINAL   SIGNS OF INFLAMMATION 
     A.   Redness (rubor) and warmth (calor) 
           O   Due to vasodilation, which results in increased blood flow 
           2.   Occurs via relaxation of arteriolar smooth muscle; key mediators are histamine, 
                 prostaglandins, and bradykinin. 
     B.   Swelling (tumor) 
           O   Due to leakage of fluid from postcapillary venules into the interstitial space 
                 (exudate) 
           2.   Key mediators are (1) histamine, which causes endothelial cell contraction and 
                 (2) tissue damage, resulting in endothelial cell disruption. 
     &   Pain (dolor) 
           O   Bradykinin  and PGE2 sensitize sensory nerve endings.

                Inflammation, 



      D.  Fever 
            l.    Pyrogens (e.g., LPS from bacteria) cause macrophages to release IL-l and 
                  TNF, which  increase cyclooxygenase activity in  perivascular cells of the 
                  hypothalamus. 
            2.   Increased PGE2 raises temperature set point. 


IV. NEUTROPHIL    ARRIVAL    AND  FUNCTION 
      A.  Step !-Margination 
            l.    Vasodilation  slows blood flow  in postcapillary  venules. 
            2.   Cells marginate from  center of flow  to the periphery. 
      B.  Step 2-Rolling 
            l.    Selectin "speed bumps" are upregulated on  endothelial cells. 
                  L   P-selectin  release from Weibel-Palade bodies is mediated by histamine. 
                  ii.   E-selectin  is induced by TNF  and IL-l. 
            2.   Selectins bind sialyl Lewis  X on leukocytes. 
            3.   Interaction  results in  rolling  of leukocytes along vessel wall. 
      C.  Step 3-Adhesion 
            O   Cellular  adhesion molecules (ICAM   and VCAM)  are upregulated  on 
                  endothelium  by TNF  and IL-l. 
            2.   Integrins  are upregulated on leukocytes  by CSa and LTB,. 
            3.   Interaction  between CAMs  and integrins  results in  firm  adhesion of leukocytes 
                  to the vessel wall. 
            4.   Leukocyte adhesion  deficiency is most commonly  due to an autosomal  recessive 
                  defect of integrins  (CD18 subunit). 
                  i.    Clinical  features include  delayed separation of the umbilical   cord, increased 
                        circulating   neutrophils  (due to impaired  adhesion of marginated  pool of 
                        leukocytes), and recurrent  bacterial  infections  that lack pus formation. 
      D.  Step 4-Transmigration     and Chemotaxis 
            l.    Leukocytes  transmigrate  across the endothelium of postcapillary   venules and 
                  move toward chemical  attractants  (chemotaxis). 
            2.   Neutrophils  are attracted  by bacterial products,  IL-8, CSa, and LTB4 

      E.  Step 5-Phagocytosis 
            l.    Consumption   of pathogens or necrotic tissue; phagocytosis is enhanced by 
                  opsonins (IgG  and C3a). 
            2.   Pseudopods extend from leukocytes  to form  phagosomes, which are internalized 
                  and merge with  lysosomes to produce phagolysosomes. 
            3.   Chediak-Higashi  syndrome  is a protein trafficking   defect (autosomal recessive) 
                  characterized by  impaired  phagolysosome formation.  Clinical  features include 
                  i.    Increased risk  of pyogenic infections 
                  ii.   Neutropenia  (due to intramedullary    death of neutrophils) 
                  iii.   Giant granules in  leukocytes (due to fusion  of granules arising  from  the 
                        Golgi  apparatus) 
                  iv.   Defective primary  hemostasis (due to abnormal  dense granules in platelets) 
                  v.   Albinism 
                  vi.   Peripheral neuropathy 
      )   Step  6-Destruction     of phagocytosed material 
            O   0 2-dependent killing  is the  most effective mechanism. 
            2.   HOC!" generated by oxidative  burst in  phagolysosomes destroys phagocytosed 
                  microbes. 
                  i.    0 2 is converted to      by NADPH  oxidase (oxidative  burst). 
                                                               by superoxide  dismutase (SOD). 
                  ii .        is converted to H20 2 
                  iii.   H20 2 is converted to HOC!" (bleach) by myeloperoxidase (MPO). 

21
           3.   Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is characterized by poor 0 ,-dependent 
                 killing. 
                 i.    Due to NADPH oxidase defect (X-linked or autosomal recessive) 
                 ii.   Leads to recurrent infection and granuloma formation with catalase-positive 
                      organisms, particularly  Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas cepacia, 
                      Serratia marcescens, Nocardia, and Aspergillus 
                 iii.  Nitroblue  tetrazolium test is used to screen for CGD. Leukocytes are 
                       incubated with NBT dye, which turns blue ifNADPH  oxidase can convert 0 , 
                       to      but remains colorless ifNADPH  oxidase is defective. 
           4.   MPO deficiency results in defective conversion ofH20 2 to HOC!'. 
                 i.    Increased risk for Candida infections; however, most patients are 
                       asymptomatic. 
                 ii.   NBT is normal; respiratory burst (02 to H20 2) is intact. 
                     -independent killing  is less effective than 0 -dependent killing and occurs via 
           5.   0 2                                                                  2 
                 enzymes present in leukocyte secondary granules (e.g., lysozyme in macro phages 
                 and major basic protein in eosinophils). 
     G.  Step ?-Resolution 
           1.   Neutrophils undergo apoptosis and disappear within 24 hours after resolution of 
                 the inflammatory  stimulus. 


9   MACROPHAGES 
     A.   Macrophages predominate after neutrophils and peak 2-3 days after inflammation 
           begins. 
           1.   Derived from monocytes in blood 
     B.   Arrive in  tissue via the margination, rolling, adhesion, and transmigration sequence 
     C.   Ingest organisms via phagocytosis (augmented by opsonins) and destroy 
           phagocytosed material using enzymes (e.g., lysozyme) in secondary granules (02-
           independent killing) 
     D.   Manage the next step of the inflammatory process. Outcomes include 
           1.   Resolution and healing-Anti-inflammatory    cytokines  (e.g., IL-10 and TGF-p) 
                 are produced by macrophages. 
           2.   Continued acute inflammation-marked    by persistent pus formation; IL-8 from 
                 macrophages recruits additional neutrophils. 
           3.   Abscess-acute inflammation  surrounded by fibrosis; macrophages mediate 
                 fibrosis via fibrogenic growth factors and cytokines. 
           4.   Chronic inflammation-Macrophages    present antigen to activate CD4+ helper T 
                 cells, which secrete cytokines that promote chronic inflammation. 



                                            CHRONIC    INFLAMMATION 

,   BASIC   PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Characterized by the presence oflymphocytes and plasma cells in tissue (Fig. 2.1B) 
     B.   Delayed response, but more specific (adaptive immunity) than acute inflammation 
     C.   Stimuli include (1) persistent infection (most common cause); (2) infection with 
           viruses, mycobacteria, parasites, and fungi; (3) autoimmune disease; (4) foreign 
           material; and (5) some cancers. 


II.   T LYMPHOCYTES 
     A.   Produced in bone marrow as progenitor T cells 
     B.   Further develop in the thymus where the T-cell receptor (TCR) undergoes 
           rearrangement and progenitor cells become CD4+ helper T cells or CDS+ cytotoxic T 
           cells 
           1.   T cells use TCR complex (TCR and CD3) for antigen surveillance. 

22
           2.   TCR complex  recognizes antigen presented on MHC  molecules. 
                 i.     CD4+ T cells-MHC    class II 
                 ii.    CDS+ T cells-MHC    class I 
           3.   Activation   ofT  cells requires (1) binding  of antigen/MHC   complex  and (2) an 
                 additional  2nd  signal. 
     C.   CD4+ helper T-cell activation 
            O   Extracellular  antigen (e.g., foreign protein)  is phagocytosed, processed, and 
                 presented on MHC  class II, which  is expressed by antigen presenting cells 
                 (APCs). 
           2.   B7 on APC  binds CD2S on CD4+ helper T cells providing   2nd activation  signal. 
           3.   Activated  CD4+ helper T cells secrete cytokines that  "help"  inflammation   and 
                 are divided  into  two subsets. 
                 i.     T H1 subset secretes IL-2 (T cell growth factor and cos+  T cell activator)  and 
                        IFN-y  (macrophage activator). 
                 ii.    T H2 subset secretes IL-4 (facilitates B-cell class switching to IgG and IgE), 
                        IL-5 (eosinophil  chemotaxis  and activation,  maturation  ofB  cells to plasma 
                        cells, and class switching to IgA),  and IL-10 (inhibits   T H1 phenotype). 
      D.  Cos+ cytotoxic  T-cell  activation 
            O   Intracellular  antigen  (derived from  proteins  in the cytoplasm)  is processed and 
                  presented on MHC class I, which  is expressed by all nucleated cells and platelets. 
            2.   IL -2 from CD4 + T H1  cell provides 2nd activation signal. 
           3.   Cytotoxic   T cells are activated for killing. 
           4.    Killing  occurs  via 
                  i.    Secretion of perforin  and granzyme;  perforin  creates pores that allow 
                        granzyme to enter  the target cell, activating  apoptosis. 
                  ii.   Expression of FasL , which binds Fas on target cells , activating apoptosis 


,,,  B  LYMPHOCYTES 
      A.  Immature   B cells are produced in the bone marrow  and undergo immunoglobulin 
            rearrangements to become naive B cells that express surface IgM and IgD. 
      B.  B-ee!! activation  occurs via 
            O   Antigen  binding  by surface IgM  or IgD;  results in maturation   to IgM- or  !gO-
                  secreting plasma cells 
            2.   B-cell antigen presentation  to CD4+ helper T cells via MHC   class II. 
                  i.    CD40 receptor  on B cell binds CD40L  on helper T cell, providing   2nd 
                        activation  signal. 
                  ii .  Helper T  cell then secretes IL-4  and IL-5  (mediate B-cell  isotype switching, 
                        hypermutation,  and maturation   to plasma cells). 


IV. GRANULOMATOUS      INFLAMMATION 
      A.  Subtype of chronic  inflammation 
      B.  Characterized  by granuloma,  which is a collection  of epithelioid  histiocytes 
            (macrophages with abundant  pink  cytoplasm), usually  surrounded  by giant cells and 
            a rim oflymphocytes 
      C.  Divided  into  noncaseating and caseating subtypes 
            O   Noncaseating granulomas  lack central  necrosis (Fig. 2.2A). Common  etiologies 
                  include reaction  to foreign  material, sarcoidosis, beryllium   exposure, Crohn 
                  disease, and cat scratch disease. 
            2.   Caseating granulomas exhibit  central  necrosis and are characteristic of 
                  tuberculosis and fungal  infections  (Fig. 2.2B). 
      D.  Steps involved in granuloma  formation 
            O   Macrophages process and present antigen via MHC  class II to CD4+ helper T 
                  cells. 

23
           2.   Interaction leads macrophages to secrete IL-12, inducing CD4+ helper T cells to 
                 differentiate into T + 1 subtype. 
           3.   T Hl cells secrete IFN-y, which converts macrophages to epithelioid histiocytes 
                 and giant cells. 



                                       PRIMARY    IMMUNODEFICIENCY 

I.   DIGEORGE  SYNDROME 
     A.   Developmental failure of the third and fourth  pharyngeal pouches 
           1.   Due to 22qll  microdeletion 
     B.   Presents with T-cell deficiency (lack of thymus); hypocalcemia (lack of parathyroids); 
           and abnormalities of heart, great vessels, and face 


II .  SEVERE COMBINED  IMMUNODEFICIENCY      (SCID) 
     A.   Defective cell-mediated and humoral immunity 
     B.   Etiologies include 
            1.  Cytokine  receptor defects-Cytokine   signaling is necessary for proliferation and 
                 maturation  of B and T cells. 
           2.   Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency-ADA   is necessary to deaminate 
                 adenosine and deoxyadenosine for excretion as waste products; buildup of 
                 adenosine and deoxyadenosine is toxic to lymphocytes. 
           3.   MHC  class II deficiency-MHC   class II is necessary for CD4+ helper T cell 
                 activation  and cytokine production. 
      C.  Characterized by susceptibility to fungal, viral, bacterial, and protozoal infections, 
           including  opportunistic  infections and live vaccines 
      D.  Treatment is sterile isolation ('bubble baby') and stem cell transplantation. 


III.  X-LINKED   AGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA 
      A.  Complete lack of immunoglobulin  due to disordered B-cell maturation 
            1.  Naive B cells cannot mature to plasma cells. 
      B.  Due to mutated Bruton tyrosine kinase; X-linked 
      C.  Presents after 6 months oflife with recurrent bacterial, enterovirus (e.g., polio and 
            coxsackievirus), and Giardia Lamblia infections; maternal antibodies present during 
            the first 6 months of life are protective. 
      D.  Live vaccines (e.g., polio) must be avoided. 


IV. COMMON   VARIABLE   IMMUNODEFICIENCY     (CVID) 
      A.  Low immunoglobulin   due to B-cell or helper T-cell defects 
      B.  Increased risk for bacterial, enterovirus, and Giardia Lamblia infections, usually in 
            late childhood

      &   Increased risk  for autoimmune  disease and lymphoma 


V.  IgA  DEFICIENCY 
      A.  Low  serum and mucosal IgA;  most common  immunoglobulin   deficiency 
      B.  Increased risk  for mucosal infection,  especially viral;  however, most patients are 
            asymptomatic. 


VI.  HYPER-IgM   SYNDROME 
      A.  Characterized  by elevated IgM 
      B.  Due to  mutated CD40L  (on helper T cells) or CD40  receptor (on B cells) 
            O   Second signal cannot be delivered to helper T  cells during  B-cell activation. 
            2.   Consequently, cytokines  necessary for immunoglobulin   class switching  are not 
                  produced. 
      C.  Low IgA,  IgG, and IgE  result in recurrent  pyogenic infections   (due to poor 
            opsonization),  especially at mucosal sites. 


VII.   WISKOTT-ALDRICH     SYNDROME 
      A.  Characterized  by thrombocytopenia,   eczema, and recurrent infections   (defective 
            humoral  and cellular  immunity) 
      B.   Due to mutation  in the  WASP gene; X-linked 


VIII.  COMPLEMENT    DEFICIENCIES 
      A.  C5-C9  deficiencies- increased  risk  for Neisseria infection  (N gonorrhoeae and N 
            meningitidis) 
      B.   Cl  inhibitor  deficiency-results    in  hereditary  angioedema, which  is characterized by 
            edema of the skin (especially periorbital,   Fig. 2.3) and mucosal surfaces 



                                              AUTOIMMUNE        DISORDERS 

I.    BASIC  PRINCIPLES 
      A.   Characterized by immune-mediated   damage of tissues 
            O   1% prevalence in the US 
      B.   Involves loss of self-tolerance 
            O   Self-reactive lymphocytes  are regularly  generated but undergo apoptosis 
                  (negative selection) in  the thymus (T  cells) or bone marrow  (B cells) or become 
                  anergic (due to recognition  of  antigen in peripheral  lymphoid   tissues with no 
                  2nd signal). 
      C.   More common  in women; classically affects women of  childbearing  age 
      D.  Etiology  is likely  an environmental   trigger in  genetically susceptible individuals 
            (increased incidence in  twins  and associated with certain  HLA  subtypes).

                                                                8.  Anemia, thrombocytopenia,  or leukopenia (due to autoantibodies against cell 
                                                                     surface proteins)

      B.  Divided  into  diffuse and localized  types 
      C.  Diffuse  type exhibits  skin and early visceral  involvement. 
            O   Almost  any organ can be involved; esophagus is commonly  affected, resulting  in 
                  disordered motility   (dysphagia for solids and liquids). 
            2.   Characterized by ANA  and anti-DNA   topoisomerase I  (Scl-70) antibody

                                                       WOUND     HEALING 

,   BASIC    PRINCIPLES 
      A.  Healing  is initiated  when inflammation    begins. 
      B.  Occurs via  a combination  of regeneration and repair 


,,   REGENERATION 
      A.  Replacement of damaged tissue with  native tissue; dependent on regenerative 
            capacity of tissue 
      B.  Tissues are divided into  three types based on regenerative capacity: labile, stable, and 
            permanent. 
      C.  Labile  tissues possess stem cells that continuously cycle to regenerate the tissue. 
            O   Small and large bowel (stem cells in  mucosal crypts, Fig. 2.5) 
            2.   Skin (stem cells in basal layer, Fig. 2.6) 
            3.   Bone marrow  (hematopoietic  stem cells) 
      D.  Stable tissues are comprised of cells that are quiescent (G0), but can reenter the cell 
            cycle to regenerate tissue when necessary. 
            O   Classic example is regeneration of liver  by compensatory hyperplasia after 
                  partial  resection. Each hepatocyte produces additional  cells and then  reenters 
                  quiescence. 
      E.  Permanent  tissues lack significant regenerative potential  (e.g., myocardium,  skeletal 
            muscle, and neurons). 


,,,  REPAIR 
      A.  Replacement of damaged tissue with  fibrous scar 
      B.  Occurs  when regenerative stem cells are lost (e.g. , deep skin cut) or when a tissue 
            lacks regenerative capacity (e.g. , healing after a myocardial infarction,  Fig. 2.7) 
      C.  Granulation   tissue formation  is the initial   phase of repair (Fig. 2.8). 

27
                Consists of fibroblasts (deposit type III collagen), capillaries (provide nutrients), 
                and myofibroblasts (contract wound) 
     D.  Eventually results in scar formation, in which type III  collagen is replaced with type 
           I collagen 
                Type III  collagen is pliable and present in granulation tissue, embryonic tissue, 
                 uterus, and keloids. 
           2.  Type I collagen has high tensile strength and is present in skin, bone, tendons, 
                 and most organs. 
           3.   Collagenase removes type III collagen and requires zinc as a cofactor. 


IV. MECHANISMS   OF TISSUE REGENERATION  AND  REPAIR 
     A.  Mediated by paracrine signaling via growth factors (e.g., macrophages secrete 
           growth factors that target fibroblasts) 
     B.  Interaction  of growth factors with receptors (e.g., epidermal growth factor with 
           growth factor receptor) results in gene expression and cellular growth. 
     C.  Examples of mediators include 
                 TGF -a- epithelial and fibroblast growth factor 
           2.                                 fibroblast growth  factor; also inhibits inflammation 
           3.   Platelet-derived growth factor-growth   factor for endothelium, smooth muscle, 
                 and fibroblasts 
           4.   Fibroblast growth factor- important   for angiogenesis; also mediates skeletal 
                 development 
           5.   Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-important    for angiogenesis 


V.  NORMAL  AND  ABERRANT   WOUND  HEALING 
     A.   Cutaneous healing occurs via primary or secondary intention. 
           1.   Primary intention-Wound    edges are brought together (e.g., suturing of a 
                 surgical incision); leads to minimal scar formation 
           2.   Secondary intention-Edges are not approximated. Granulation tissue fills the 
                 defect; myofibroblasts then contract the wound, forming a scar. 
     B.   Delayed wound healing occurs in 
           O   Infection  (most common cause; S au reus is the most common offender) 
           2.   Vitamin  C, copper, or zinc deficiency 
                 L   Vitamin   C is an important cofactor in the hydroxylation of proline and 
                       lysine procollagen residues; hydroxylation is necessary for eventual collagen 
                       cross-linking. 
                 ii .  Copper is a cofactor for lysyl oxidase, which cross-links lysine and 
                       hydroxylysine to form stable collagen. 
                 iii . Zinc  is a cofactor for collagenase, which replaces the type III collagen of 
                       granulation tissue with stronger type I collagen.

           3.   Other  causes include foreign  body, ischemia, diabetes, and malnutrition. 
     C.   Dehiscence is rupture  of a wound;  most commonly  seen after abdominal  surgery 
     D.   Hypertrophic   scar is excess production of  scar tissue that is localized  to the wound 
           (Fig.  2.9). 
     E.   Keloid  is excess production of scar tissue that  is out of proportion   to the  wound  (Fig. 
           2.10). 

            1.   Characterized by excess type III  collagen 
           2.    Genetic predisposition  (more  common  in African   Americans) 
            3.   Classically affects earlobes, face, and upper extremities

                   Principles                        of       Neoplasia 







                                                    NEOPLASIA 

,   BASIC PRINCIPLES 
    A.  Neoplasia is new tissue growth that is unregulated, irreversible, and monoclonal; 
          these features distinguish it from hyperplasia and repair. 
     B. Monoclonal means that the neoplastic cells are derived from a single mother cell. 
     C. Clonality can be determined by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) 
          enzyme isoforms. 
          ,   Multiple isoforms (e.g., G6PDA, G6PD8, and G6PDc) exist; only one isoform is 
               inherited from each parent. 
          2.  In females, one isoform is randomly inactivated in each cell by Iyonization 
               (G6PD is present on the X chromosome). 
          3.  Normal ratio of active isoforms in cells of any tissue is 1:1 (e.g., 50% of cells have 
               G6PDA, and 50% of cells have G6PD8). 
          4.  1:1 ratio is maintained in hyperplasia, which is polyclonal (cells are derived from 
               multiple cells). 
          5.  Only one isoform is present in neoplasia, which is monoclonal. 
          6.  Clonality can also be determined by androgen receptor isoforms, which are also 
               present on the X chromosome. 
     D. Clonality ofB lymphocytes is determined by immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain 
          phenotype. 
          ,   Ig is comprised of heavy and light chains. 
          2.  Each B cell expresses light chain that is either kappa or lambda. 
          3.  Normal kappa to lambda light chain ratio is 3:1. 
          4.  This ratio is maintained in hyperplasia, which is polyclonal. 
          5.  Ratio increases to ! 6:1 or is inverted (e.g. , kappa to lambda ratio = 1: 3) in 
               lymphoma, which is monoclonal. 
     E. Neoplastic tumors are benign or malignant. 
          ,   Benign tumors remain localized and do not metastasize. 
          2.  Malignant tumors (cancer) invade locally and have the potential to metastasize. 
     F.  Tumor nomenclature is based on lineage of differentiation (type of tissue produced) 
          and whether the tumor is benign or malignant (Table 3.1).

II.  EPIDEMIOLOGY 
     A.  Cancer is the 2nd leading cause of death in both adults and children. 
           O   The leading causes of death in adults are (l) cardiovascular disease, (2) cancer, 
                 and (3) cerebrovascular disease. 
           2.   The leading causes of death in children are (l) accidents, (2) cancer, and (3) 
                 congenital defects. 
     B.  The most common cancers by incidence in adults are (l) breast/prostate, (2) lung, 
           and (3) colorectal. 
     C.  The most common causes of cancer mortality in adults are (l) lung, (2) breast/ 
           prostate, and (3) colorectal. 


,OO  ROLE OF SCREENING 
     A.   Cancer begins as a single mutated cell. 
     B.   Approximately 30 divisions occur before the earliest clinical symptoms arise. 
     &   Each division (doubling time) results in increased mutations. 
           O   Cancers that do not produce symptoms until late in disease will have undergone 
                 additional divisions and, hence, additional mutations. 
           2.   Cancers that are detected late tend to have a poor prognosis. 
      D.  Goal of screening is to catch dysplasia (precancerous change) before it becomes 
           carcinoma or carcinoma before clinical symptoms arise. 
      E.  Common screening methods include 
           O   Pap smear-detects cervical dysplasia (CIN) before it becomes carcinoma 
           2.   Mammography-detects  in  situ breast cancer (e.g., DCIS) before LW invades or 
                 invasive carcinoma before it becomes clinically palpable 
           3.   Prostate specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal exam- detects prostate 
                 carcinoma before it spreads 
           4.   Hemoccult test (for occult blood in stool) and colonoscopy-detect colonic 
                 adenoma before it becomes colonic carcinoma or carcinoma before it spreads 



                                                    CARCINOGENESIS 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
      A.  Cancer formation is initiated by damage to DNA of stem cells. The damage 
           overcomes DNA repair mechanisms, but is not lethal. 
            O   Carcinogens are agents that damage DNA, increasing the risk for cancer. 
                 Important  carcinogens include chemicals, oncogenic viruses, and radiation 
                 (Table 3.2). 
      B.  DNA mutations eventually disrupt key regulatory systems, allowing for tumor 
           promotion  (growth) and progression (spread). 
            O   Disrupted systems include proto-oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and 
                 regulators of apoptosis. 


II.   ONCOGENES 
      A.  Proto-oncogenes are essential for cell growth and differentiation; mutations of 
           proto-oncogenes form oncogenes that lead to unregulated cellular growth. 
      B.  Categories of oncogenes include growth factors, growth factor receptors, signal 
            transducers, nuclear regulators, and cell cycle regulators (Table 3.3). 
            O   Growth factors induce cellular growth (e.g., PDGFB in astrocytoma). 
           2.   Growth  factor receptors mediate signals from growth factors (e.g., ERBB2 
                  [HER2/neu] in breast cancer). 
            3.  Signal transducers relay receptor activation to the nucleus (e.g. , ras). 
                 L   Ras is associated with growth factor receptors in an inactive GDP-bound 
                       state.

           2.   If DNA  repair is not possible, p53 induces apoptosis. 
                 i.    p53 upregulates BAX, which disrupts Bcl2. 
                 ii .  Cytochrome c leaks from the mitochondria activating  apoptosis. 
           3.   Both copies of the p53 gene must be knocked out for tumor formation (Knudson 
                 two-hit  hypothesis). 
                 i.    Loss is seen in ! 50% of cancers. 
                 ii.   Germline  mutation results in Li-Fraumeni  syndrome (2nd hit is somatic), 
                       characterized by the propensity to develop multiple types of carcinomas and 
                       sarcomas. 
     C.   Rb also regulates progression from G, to S phase. 
           O   Rb "holds" the E2F transcription  factor, which is necessary for transition to the S 
                 phase. 
           2.   E2F is released when RB is phosphorylated by the cyclinD/cyclin-dependent 
                 kinase 4 (CDK4) complex. 
           3.   Rb mutation results in constitutively  free E2F, allowing progression through the 
                 cell cycle and uncontrolled growth of cells. 
           4.   Both copies ofRb gene must be knocked out for tumor formation (Knudson  two-
                 hit hypothesis). 
                 L   Sporadic mutation  (both hits are somatic) is characterized by unilateral 
                       retinoblastoma (Fig. 3.1). 
                 ii.   Germline  mutation results in familial  retinoblastoma (2nd hit  is somatic), 
                       characterized by bilateral retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma. 


IV. REGULATORS  OF APOPTOSIS 
      A.  Prevent apoptosis in normal cells, but promote apoptosis in mutated cells whose 
           DNA  cannot be repaired (e.g. , Bcl2) 
            O   Bcl2 normally stabilizes the mitochondrial membrane, blocking release of 
                 cytochrome c. 
           2.   Disruption  ofBcl2  allows cytochrome c to leave the mitochondria and activate 
                 apoptosis. 
      B.  Bcl2 is overexpressed in follicular lymphoma. 
            O   t(l4;18) moves Bcl2 (chromosome 18) to the Ig heavy chain locus (chromosome 
                 14), resulting in increased Bcl2. 
           2.   Mitochondrial   membrane is further stabilized, prohibiting  apoptosis. 
           3.   B cells that would normally undergo apoptosis during somatic hypermutation  in 
                 the lymph node germinal center accumulate, leading to lymphoma. 


V.  OTHER  IMPORTANT   FEATURES  OF TUMOR  DEVELOPMENT 
      A.  Telomerase is necessary for cell immortality.

                                                               1.   Normally, telomeres shorten with serial cell divisions, eventually resulting in 
                                                                     cellular senescence. 
                                                               2.   Cancers often have upregulated telomerase, which preserves telomeres. 
                                                          B.  Angiogenesis (production of new blood vessels) is necessary for tumor survival and 
                                                               growth. 
                                                               1.   FGF and VEGF (angiogenic factors) are commonly produced by tumor cells. 
                                                          C.  Avoiding immune surveillance is necessary for tumor survival. 
                                                               1.   Mutations often result in production of abnormal proteins, which are expressed 
                                                                     on MHC class I. 
                                                               2.   CDS T cells detect and destroy such mutated cells. 
                                                               3.   Tumor cells can evade immune surveillance by downregulating expression of 
                                                                     MHC  class I. 
                                                               4.   Immunodeficiency (both primary  and secondary) increases risk for cancer.

                                                    I.    TUMOR  INVASION  AND  SPREAD 
                                                          A.  Accumulation of mutations eventually results in tumor invasion and spread. 
                                                                1.  Epithelial tumor  cells are normally attached to one another by cellular adhesion 
                                                                     molecules (e.g., E-cadherin). 
                                                                2.  Downregulation  of E-cadherin leads to dissociation of attached cells. 
                                                                3.  Cells attach to laminin and destroy basement membrane (collagen type IV) via 
                                                                     collagenase. 
                                                               4.   Cells attach to fibronectin in the extracellular matrix and spread locally. 
                                                                5.  Entrance into vascular or lymphatic spaces allows for metastasis (distant spread). 


                                                    II.   ROUTES OF METASTASIS 
                                                          A.  Lymphatic spread is characteristic of carcinomas. 
                                                                1.  Initial  spread is to regional draining lymph nodes (Fig. 3.2). 
                                                          B.  Hematogenous spread is characteristic of sarcomas and some carcinomas. 
                                                                1.  Renal cell carcinoma (often invades renal vein) 
                                                                2.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (often invades hepatic vein) 
                                                                3.  Follicular  carcinoma of the thyroid 
                                                                4.  Choriocarcinoma 
                                                          C.  Seeding of body cavities is characteristic of ovarian carcinoma, which often involves 
                                                                the peritoneum ('omental caking', Fig. 3.3).

                                                  Principles 



                                          CLINICAL    CHARACTERISTICS 

I.   CLINICAL    FEATURES 
     A.   Benign tumors tend to be slow growing, well circumscribed, distinct,  and mobile. 
     B.   Malignant tumors  are usually rapid growing, poorly circumscribed,  infiltrative,  and 
           fixed to surrounding  tissues and local structures. 
     C.   Biopsy or excision is generally required before a tumor can be classified as benign or 
           malignant  with certainty. 
            1.  Some benign tumors can grow in a malignant-like fashion, and some malignant 
                 tumors can grow in a benign-like  fashion. 


II.   HISTOLOGIC   FEATURES 
      A.  Benign tumors are usually well differentiated (Fig. 3.4A). Characteristics include 
            1.  Organized growth 
           2.   Uniform  nuclei 
            3.  Low nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio 
           4.   Minimal   mitotic  activity 
            5.  Lack of invasion (of basement membrane or local tissue) 
            6.  No metastatic potential 
      B.  Malignant  tumors are classicall y poorly differentiated (anaplastic, Fig. 3.4B). 
            Characteristics include 
            1.  Disorganized growth  (loss of polarity) 
            2.  Nuclear pleomorphism  and hyperchromasia 
            3.  High  nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio 
            4.  High  mitotic  activity with  atypical mitosis 
            5.  Invasion  (through basement membrane or into local tissue) 
      C.  Metastatic potential is the hallmark  of malignancy-benign    tumors never 
            metastasize.

     D.  Immunohistochemistry   is used to characterize tumors that are difficult to classify 
           on histology (Fig. 3.5, Table 3.4). 


III. SERUM TUMOR   MARKERS 
     A.   Proteins released by tumor into serum (e.g., PSA) 
     B.   Useful for screening, monitoring response to treatment, and monitoring recurrence 
     C.  Elevated levels require tissue biopsy for diagnosis of carcinoma (e.g., biopsy of 
           prostate with elevated PSA). 


IV. GRADING   OF CANCER 
     A.   Microscopic assessment of differentiation (i.e., how much a cancer resembles the 
           tissue in which it grows); takes into account architectural and nuclear features 
           1.   Well differentiated (low grade)-resembles  normal parent tissue 
           2.   Poorly differentiated (high grade)-does   not resemble parent tissue 
      B.  Important  for determining  prognosis; well-differentiated cancers have better 
           prognosis than poorly-differentiated cancers. 


V.  STAGING  OF CANCER 
      A.  Assessment of size and spread of a cancer 
      B.  Key prognostic factor; more important than grade 
      C.  Determined after final surgical resection of the tumor 
      D.  Utilizes TNM  staging system 
            1.  T -tumor   (size and/or depth of invasion) 
           2.   N- spread  to regional lymph nodes; second most important prognostic factor 
           3.   M- metastasis;  single most important prognostic factor

                             Related                    Disorders 





                                                 INTRODUCTION 

,   HEMOSTASIS 
     A. Integrity of the blood vessel is necessary to carry blood to tissues. 
          1.  Damage to the wall is repaired by hemostasis, which involves formation of a 
               thrombus (clot) at the site of vessel injury. 
     B.  Hemostasis occurs in two stages: primary and secondary. 
          1.  Primary hemostasis forms a weak platelet plug and is mediated by interaction 
               between platelets and the vessel wall. 
          2.  Secondary hemostasis stabilizes the platelet plug and is mediated by the 
               coagulation cascade. 


       PRIMARY  HEMOSTASIS  AND  RELATED BLEEDING  DISORDERS 

,   PRIMARY HEMOSTASIS 
     A.  Step 1-Transient vasoconstriction of damaged vessel 
          1.  Mediated by reflex neural stimulation and endothelin release from endothelial 
               cells 
     B.  Step 2-Platelet adhesion to the surface of disrupted vessel 
          1.  Von Willebrand factor (vWF) binds exposed subendothelial collagen. 
          2.  Platelets bind vWF using the GPib receptor. 
          3.  vWF is derived from the Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells and 
               a-granules of platelets. 
     C. Step 3-Platelet degranulation 
          1.  Adhesion induces shape change in platelets and degranulation with release of 
               multiple mediators. 
               i.    ADP is released from platelet dense granules; promotes exposure ofGPIIb/ 
                    Ilia  receptor on platelets. 
               ii.   TXA2 is synthesized by platelet cyclooxygenase (COX) and released; 
                    promotes platelet aggregation 
     D. Step 4-Platelet aggregation 
          1.  Platelets aggregate at the site of injury via GPIIb/IIIa using fibrinogen (from 
               plasma) as a linking molecule; results in formation of platelet plug 
          2.  Platelet plug is weak; coagulation cascade (secondary hemostasis) stabilizes it. 


II.  DISORDERS OF PRIMARY HEMOSTASIS 
     A.  Usually due to abnormalities in platelets; divided into quantitative or qualitative 
          disorders 
     B.  Clinical features include mucosal and skin bleeding. 
          1.  Symptoms of mucosal bleeding include epistaxis (most common overall 
               symptom), hemoptysis, GI bleeding, hematuria, and menorrhagia. Intracranial 
               bleeding occurs with severe thrombocytopenia. 
          2.  Symptoms of skin bleeding include petechiae (1-2 mm, Fig. 4.1), ecchymoses 
               (> 3 mm), purpura (> 1 em), and easy bruising; petechiae are a sign of 
               thrombocytopenia and are not usually seen with qualitative disorders. 

39
     C.  Useful laboratory studies include 
           1.   Platelet count-normallS0-400    K/fiL;     50 K/fiL leads to symptoms. 
           2.   Bleeding time- normal  2- 7 minutes; prolonged with quantitative and qualitative 
                 platelet disorders 
           3.   Blood smear-used  to assess number and size of platelets 
           4.   Bone marrow biopsy-used to  assess megakaryocytes, which produce platelets 


,,,  IMMUNE   THROMBOCYTOPENIC    PURPURA  (ITP) 
     A.   Autoimmune production  oflgG  against platelet antigens (e.g., GPI!b/IIIa) 
           1.   Most common cause of thrombocytopenia in children and adults 
     B.   Autoantibodies are produced by plasma cells in the spleen. 
     C.  Antibody-bound  platelets are consumed by splenic macrophages, resulting in 
           thrombocytopenia. 
      D.  Divided into acute and chronic forms 
           1.   Acute form arises in children weeks after a viral infection or immunization; self-
                 limited,  usually resolving within weeks of presentation 
           2.   Chronic form arises in adults, usually women of childbearing age. May be 
                 primary  or secondary (e.g., SLE). May cause short-lived thrombocytopenia in 
                 offspring since antiplatelet IgG can cross the placenta. 
      E.  Laboratory findings include 
           1.   ,J, platelet count, often   50 K/fiL 
           2.   Normal PT/PTT-Coagulation    factors are not affected. 
           3.   L  megakaryocytes on bone marrow biopsy 
      F.  Initial  treatment is corticosteroids. Children respond well; adults may show early 
           response, but often relapse. 
           1.   IVIG  is used to raise the platelet count in symptomatic bleeding, but its effect is 
                 short-lived. 
           2.   Splenectomy eliminates the primary source of antibody and the site of platelet 
                 destruction (performed in  refractory cases). 


IV. MICROANGIOPATHIC    HEMOLYTIC   ANEMIA 
      A.  Pathologic formation of platelet microthrombi in  small vessels 
            O   Platelets are consumed in the formation of microthrombi. 
           2.   RBCs are "sheared" as they cross microthrombi, resulting in hemolytic anemia 
                 with  schistocytes (Fig. 4.2). 
      %   Seen in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP} and hemolytic uremic 
           syndrome (HUS) 
      C.  TTP is due to decreased ADAMTS13, an enzyme that normally cleaves vWF 
           multimers  into smaller monomers for eventual degradation.

40
           O   Large, uncleaved multimers lead to abnormal platelet adhesion, resulting in 
                 microthrombi. 
           2.   Decreased ADAMTS13 is usually due to an acquired autoantibody; most 
                 commonly seen in adult females 
     D.  HUS is due to endothelial damage by drugs or infection. 
           O   Classically seen in children withE  coli Ol57:H7 dysentery, which results from 
                 exposure to undercooked beef 
           2.   E coli verotoxin damages endothelial cells resulting in platelet microthrombi. 
     E.   Clinical findings  (HUS and TTP) include 
           O   Skin and mucosal bleeding 
           2.   Microangiopathic  hemolytic anemia 
           3.   Fever 
           4.   Renal insufficiency (more common in HUS)-Thrombi    involve vessels of the 
                 kidney. 
           5.   CNS abnormalities (more common in TTP)-Thrombi    involve vessels of the 
                 CNS. 
     F.   Laboratory findings  include 
           O   Thrombocytopenia  with W  bleeding time 
           2.   Normal  PT/PTT (coagulation cascade is not activated) 
           3.   Anemia with  schistocytes 
           4.   W  megakaryocytes on bone marrow biopsy 
     G.  Treatment involves plasmapheresis and corticosteroids, particularly in TTP. 


V.  QUALITATIVE    PLATELET  DISORDERS 
     A.   Bernard-Soulier syndrome is due to a genetic GPib deficiency; platelet adhesion is 
           impaired. 
            I.   Blood smear shows mild thrombocytopenia with  enlarged platelets. 
     B.   Glanzmann thrombasthenia is due to a genetic GP!Ib/IIIa deficiency; platelet 
           aggregation is impaired. 
                                                                                                            impairs aggregation. 
     C.   Aspirin  irreversibly inactivates cyclooxygenase; lack ofTXA2 
     D.   Uremia disrupts platelet function; both  adhesion and aggregation are impaired. 



                SECONDARY     HEMOSTASIS     AND   RELATED    DISORDERS 

,   SECONDARY   HEMOSTASIS 
     A.   Stabilizes the weak platelet plug via the coagulation cascade 
           O   Coagulation cascade generates thrombin, which converts fibrinogen in the 
                 platelet plug to fibrin. 
           2.   Fibrin  is then cross-linked, yielding a stable platelet-fibrin thrombus. 
     B.   Factors of the coagulation cascade are produced by the liver in an inactive state. 
           Activation  requires 
           l.    Exposure to an activating substance 
                 L   Tissue thromboplastin  activates factor VII  (extrinsic pathway). 
                 ii.   Subendothelial collagen activates factor XII (intrinsic  pathway). 
           2.   Phospholipid surface of platelets 
           3.   Calcium (d erived from platelet dense granules) 


II.  DISORDERS  OF SECONDARY  HEMOSTASIS 
     A.   Usually due to factor abnormalities 
      B.  Clinical  features include deep tissue bleeding into muscles and joints (hemarthrosis) 
           and rebleeding after surgical procedures (e.g., circumcision and wisdom tooth 
           extraction). 
      C.  Laboratory studies include 

41
           1.   Prothrombin  time (PT)-measures  extrinsic  (factor VII)  and common (factors 
                 II, V, X, and fibrinogen) pathways of the coagulation cascade 
           2.   Partial thromboplastin  time (PTT)-measures   intrinsic  (factors XII, XI,  IX, 
                 VIII)  and common (factors ,,  V, X, and fibrinogen) pathways of the coagulation 
                 cascade 


,,,  HEMOPHILIA     A 
      A.  Genetic factor VITI (FVIII)  deficiency 
           1.   X-linked  recessive (predominantly affects males) 
           2.   Can arise from a new mutation (de novo) without any family history 
      B.  Presents with deep tissue, joint, and postsurgical bleeding 
           1.   Clinical  severity depends on the degree of deficiency. 
      C.  Laboratory findings include 
            1.  W  PTT; normal PT 
           2.   -1. FVIII 
           3.   Normal  platelet count and bleeding time 
      D.  Treatment involves recombinant FVIII. 


IV. HEMOPHILIA    B  (CHRISTMAS  DISEASE) 
      A.  Genetic factor IX deficiency 
            1.  Resembles hemophilia A, except FIX levels are decreased instead of FVIII 


V.   COAGULATION   FACTOR INHIBITOR 
      A.  Acquired antibody  against a coagulation factor resulting in impaired factor 
            function; anti-FVIII   is most common. 
            1.  Clinical  and lab findings are similar to hemophilia A. 
            2.  PTT  does not correct upon mixing normal plasma with patient's plasma (mixing 
                 study) due to inhibitor;  PTT does correct in hemophilia A. 


VI.  VON WILLEBRAND    DISEASE 
      A.  Genetic vWF deficiency 
                 Most  common inherited coagulation disorder 
      %   Multiple subtypes exist, causing quantitative and qualitative defects; the most 
            common type is autosomal dominant with decreased vWF levels. 
      C.  Presents with mild mucosal and skin bleeding; low vWF impairs platelet adhesion. 
      D.  Laboratory findings  include 
            1.   W  bleeding time 
            2.   W  PTT; normal PT- Decreased FVIII half-life (vWF normally stabilizes FVIII); 
                  however, deep tissue, joint, and postsurgical bleeding are usually not seen. 
            3.   Abnormal ristocetin test- Ristocetin  induces platelet aggregation by causing 
                  vWF to bind platelet GPib; lack of vWF -t impaired aggregation -t abnormal test. 
      E.  Treatment is desmopressin (ADH analog), which increases vWF release from 
            Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells. 


VII.  VITAMIN    K DEFICIENCY 
      A.  Disrupts  function  of multiple coagulation factors 
            1.   Vitamin  K is activated by epoxide reductase in the liver. 
            2.   Activated vitamin  K gamma carboxylates factors II, VII, IX, X, and proteins C 
                  and S; gamma carboxylation is necessary for factor function. 
      B.   Deficiency occurs in 
            1.   Newborns- due  to lack of GI colonization by bacteria that normally synthesize 
                  vitamin  K; vitamin  K injection is given prophylactically to all newborns at birth 
                  to prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. 

42
           2.   Long-term antibiotic  therapy-disrupts   vitamin  K-producing  bacteria in the GI 
                 tract 
           3.   Malabsorption-leads   to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin  K 


VIII. OTHER  CAUSES OF ABNORMAL  SECONDARY  HEMOSTASIS 
     A.   Liver failure-decreased  production  of coagulation factors and decreased activation 
           of vitamin  K by epoxide reductase; effect of liver failure on coagulation is followed 
           using PT. 
     B.   Large-volume transfusion-dilutes   coagulation factors, resulting in a relative 
           deficiency 



                                  OTHER   DISORDERS    OF  HEMOSTASIS 

,   HEPARIN-INDUCED      THROMBOCYTOPENIA 
     A.   Platelet destruction that arises secondary to heparin therapy 
      B.  Fragments of destroyed platelets may activate remaining platelets, leading to 
           thrombosis. 


II.   DISSEMINATED   INTRAVASCULAR   COAGULATION 
      A.  Pathologic activation of the coagulation cascade 
           1.   Widespread microthrombi  result in ischemia and infarction. 
           2.   Consumption of platelets and factors results in bleeding, especially from IV sites 
                 and mucosal surfaces (bleeding from body orifices). 
      B.  Almost always secondary to another disease process 
           1.   Obstetric complications-Tissue   thromboplastin  in the amniotic fluid  activates 
                 coagulation. 
           2.   Sepsis (especially withE Coli or N meningitidis)-Endotoxins   from the bacterial 
                 wall and cytokines (e.g., TNF and IL-l)  induce endothelial cells to make tissue 
                 factor. 
           3.   Adenocarcinoma- Mucin   activates coagulation. 
           4.   Acute promyelocytic leukemia-Primary    granules activate coagulation. 
           5.   Rattlesnake bite- Venom activates coagulation. 
      C.  Laboratory findings include 
           1.   ,J, platelet count 
           2.   W  PT/PTT 
           3.   ,J, fibrinogen 
           4.   Microangiopathic  hemolytic anemia 
           5.   Elevated fibrin split products, particularly  D-dimer 
                 i.    Elevated D-dimer is the best screening test for DIC. 
                 ii.   Derived from  splitting of cross-linked fibrin;  D-dimer  is not produced from 
                       splitting  of fibrinogen. 
      D.  Treatment involves addressing the underlying cause and transfusing blood products 
           and cryoprecipitate (contains coagulation factors), as necessary. 


III.  DISORDERS OF FIBRINOLYSIS 
      A.  Normal fibrinolysis  removes thrombus after damaged vessel heals. 

           1.   Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) converts plasminogen to plasmin. 
           2.   Plasmin cleaves fibrin and serum fibrinogen, destroys coagulation factors, and 
                 blocks platelet aggregation. 
           3.   a2-antiplasmin  inactivates plasmin. 
      B.  Disorders of fibrinolysis are due to plasmin overactivity resulting in excessive 
           cleavage of serum fibrinogen. Examples include 
            1.  Radical prostatectomy-Release of urokinase activates plasmin. 

43
           2.   Cirrhosis of liver-reduced   production of a2-antiplasmin 
     C.  Presents with increased bleeding (resembles DIC) 
     D.  Laboratory findings  include 
           1.   W  PT/PTT-Plasmin destroys coagulation factors. 
           2.   t  bleeding time with  normal platelet count-Plasmin   blocks platelet aggregation. 
           3.   Increased fibrinogen split products without D-dimers-Serum    fibrinogen is 
                 lysed; however, D-dimers are not formed because fibrin thrombi are absent. 
     E.   Treatment is aminocaproic acid, which blocks activation of plasminogen. 



                                                         THROMBOSIS 

,   BASIC   PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Pathologic formation of an intravascular blood clot (thrombus) 
           1.   Can occur in an artery or vein 
           2.   Most common location is the deep veins (DVT) of the leg below the knee. 
     B.   Characterized by (l) lines of Zahn (alternating layers of platelets/fibrin and RBCs, 
           Fig. 4.3) and (2) attachment to vessel wall 
           1.   Both features distinguish thrombus from  postmortem clot. 
     C.   Three major risk factors for thrombosis are disruption in blood flow, endothelial cell 
           damage, and hypercoagulable state (Virchow triad). 


,,   DISRUPTION   IN  NORMAL  BLOOD  FLOW 
     A.   Stasis and turbulence of blood flow increases risk for thrombosis. 
           1.   Blood flow is normally continuous and laminar;  keeps platelets and factors 
                 dispersed and inactivated 
      B.  Examples include 
           1.   Immobilization- increased   risk for deep venous thrombosis 
           2.   Cardiac wall dysfunction  (e .g., arrhythmia or myocardial infarction) 
           3.   Aneurysm 


,,,  ENDOTHELIAL     CELL DAMAGE 
     A.   Endothelial damage disrupts the protective function of endothelial cells, increasing 
           the risk for thrombosis. 
      B.  Endothelial cells prevent thrombosis by several mechanisms. 
           1.   Block exposure to subendothelial collagen and underlying tissue factor 
           2.   Produce prostacyclin (PGI,) and NO-vasodilation   and inhibition   of platelet 
                 aggregation 
           3.   Secrete heparin-like molecules-augment  antithrombin  III  (ATIII),  which 
                 inactivates thrombin  and coagulation factors 


















                                                                               Fig. 4.3 /LQHV RI =DKQ FKDUDFWHUL]HG E\ 
                                                                               DOWHUQDWLQJ OD\HUV RI SODWHOHWV ILEULQ DQG 5%&V  

44
           4.   Secrete tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-converts plasminogen to plasmin, 
                which  (l)  cleaves fibrin and serum fibrinogen, (2) destroys coagulation factors, 
                 and (3) blocks platelet aggregation 
           5.   Secrete thrombomodulin-redirects   thrombin   to activate protein C, which 
                 inactivates factors V and VIII 
     C.  Causes of endothelial cell damage include atherosclerosis, vasculitis, and high levels 
           of homocysteine. 
           O   Vitamin  B12 and folate deficiency result in mildly elevated homocysteine levels, 
                 increasing the risk for thrombosis. 
                 i.    Folic acid (tetrahydrofolate, THF) circulates as methyl-THF in the serum. 
                 ii.   Methyl is transferred to cobalamin  (vitamin  Bl2), allowing THF  to 
                       participate in the synthesis of DNA precursors. 
                 iii.  Cobalamin  transfers methyl to homocysteine resulting in methionine. 
                 iv.  Lack of vitamin  Bl2 or folate leads to decreased conversion of homocysteine 
                       to methionine resulting  in buildup of homocysteine. 
           2.   Cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) deficiency results in high homocysteine levels 
                 with homocystinuria. 
                 i.    CBS converts homocysteine to cystathionine; enzyme deficiency leads to 
                       homocysteine buildup. 
                 ii.   Characterized by vessel thrombosis, mental retardation, lens dislocation, and 
                       long slender fingers. 


IV HYPERCOAGULABLESTATE 
     A.   Due to excessive procoagulant proteins or defective anticoagulant proteins; may be 
           inherited  or acquired 
     B.   Classic presentation is recurrent DVTs or DVT at a young age . 
           O   Usually occurs in the deep veins of the leg; other sites include hepatic and 
                 cerebral veins. 
     C.   Protein C or S deficiency (autosomal dominant) decreases negative feedback on the 
           coagulation cascade. 
           O   Proteins C and S normally inactivate factors V and VIII. 
           2.   Increased risk for warfarin  skin necrosis 
                 i.    Initial  stage of warfarin therapy results in a temporary deficiency of proteins 
                       C and S (due to shorter half-life) relative to factors II, VII, IX, and X 
                 ii .  In  preexisting Cor  S deficiency, a severe deficiency is seen at the onset of 
                       warfarin  therapy increasing risk for thrombosis, especially in the skin. 
     D.   Factor V Leiden is a mutated form of factor V that lacks the cleavage site for 
           deactivation by proteins C and S. 
           O   Most common inherited  cause ofhypercoagulable state 
     E.   Prothrombin  20210A is an inherited point mutation in  prothrombin  that results in 
           increased gene expression. 
           O   Increased prothrombin  results in increased thrombin, promoting  thrombus 
                 formation. 
     F.   A Till  deficiency decreases the protective effect of heparin-like molecules produced 
           by the endothelium, increasing the risk for thrombus. 
           O   Heparin-like  molecules normally activate ATIII,  which  inactivates thrombin and 
                 coagulation factors. 
           2.   In ATIII   deficiency, PTT does not rise with standard heparin dosing. 
                 i.    Pharmacologic heparin works by binding and activating  A Till. 
                 ii.   High  doses of heparin activate limited ATIII;  coumadin is then given to 
                       maintain  an anticoagulated state. 
     G.  Oral  contraceptives are associated with a hypercoagulable state.

                                                                      the risk for thrombosis.

                                                                on the vessel involved. 
                                                           B.  Thromboembolus is due to a thrombus that dislodges; most common type of 
                                                                embolus (>95%) 
                                                           &   Atherosclerotic embolus is due to an atherosclerotic plaque that dislodges. 
                                                                1.   Characterized by the presence of cholesterol clefts in the embolus (Fig. 4.4A) 
                                                           D.  Fat embolus is associated with bone fractures, particularly long bones, and soft 
                                                                tissue trauma. 
                                                                1.   Develops while fracture is still present or shortly after repair 
                                                                2.   Characterized by dyspnea (fat, often with bone marrow elements, is seen in 
                                                                      pulmonary  vessels, Fig. 4.4B) and petechiae on the skin overlying the chest 
                                                           E.  Gas embolus is classically seen in decompression sickness. 
                                                                 1.  Nitrogen gas precipitates out of blood due to rapid ascent by a diver. 
                                                                2.   Presents with joint and muscle pain ('bends') and respiratory symptoms 
                                                                      ('chokes'). 
                                                                3.   Chronic  form (Caisson disease) is characterized by multifocal ischemic necrosis 
                                                                      of bone. 
                                                                4.   Gas embolus may also occur during laparoscopic surgery (air is pumped into the

                                                        ANEMIA 
,   BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A. Reduction in circulating red blood cell (RBC) mass 
     B.  Presents with signs and symptoms of hypoxia 
          ,   Weakness, fatigue, and dyspnea 
          2.  Pale conjunctiva and skin 
          3.  Headache and lightheadedness 
          4.  Angina, especially with preexisting coronary artery disease 
     C. Hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), and RBC count are used as surrogates for RBC 
          mass, which is difficult to measure. 
          1.  Anemia is defined as Hb < 13.5 g/dL in males and < 12 .5 g/dL in females (normal 
               Hb is 13.5 - 17.5 g/dL in males and 12.5-16.0 g/dL in females). 
     D. Based on mean corpuscular volume (MCV), anemia can be classified as microcytic 
          (MCV < 80 11m' ), normocytic (MCV = 80- 100 11m' ), or macrocytic (MCV ! 100 
          llm' ). 


                                          MICROCYTIC   ANEMIAS 
,   BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A.  Anemia with MCV < 80 11m' 
     B.  Microcytic anemias are due to decreased production of hemoglobin. 
               RBC progenitor cells in the bone marrow are large and normally divide multiple 
               times to produce smaller mature cells (MCV   80-100 11m' ). 
          2.  Microcytosis is due to an "extra" division which occurs to maintain hemoglobin 
               concentration. 
     C.  Hemoglobin is made of heme and globin; heme is composed of iron and 
          protoporphyrin. A decrease in any of these components leads to microcytic anemia. 
     D. Microcytic anemias include (1) iron deficiency anemia, (2) anemia of chronic 
          di sease, (3) sideroblastic anemia, and (4) thalassemia. 


II . IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA 
     A.  Due to decreased levels of iron 
               ..!. iron     ..!. heme     ..!. hemoglobin     microcytic anemia 
     B.  Most common type of anemia 
               Lack of iron is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, affecting 
               roughly 1/3 of world 's population. 
     C.  Iron is consumed in heme (meat-derived) and non-heme (vegetable-derived) forms. 
          1.  Absorption occurs in the duodenum. Enterocytes have heme and non-heme 
               (DMTl) transporters; the heme form is more readily absorbed. 
          2.  Enterocytes transport iron across the cell membrane into blood via ferroportin. 
          3.  Transferrin transports iron in the blood and delivers it to liver and bone marrow 
               macrophages for storage. 
          4.  Stored intracellular iron is bound to ferritin, which prevents iron from forming 
               free radicals via the Fenton reaction. 

49
     D.  Laboratory measurements of iron status 
           1.  Serum iron-measure   of iron in the blood 
           2.  Total iron-binding  capacity (TIBC)-measure   of transferrin molecules in the 
                blood 
           3.   %saturation- percentage of transferrin  molecules that are bound by iron 
                 (normal is 33%) 
           4.  Serum ferritin-reflects    iron stores in macrophages and the liver 
     E.  Iron  deficiency is usually caused by dietary lack or blood loss. 
           1.   Infants-breast-feeding  (human milk  is low in iron) 
           2.   Children-poor    diet 
           3.   Adults (20-50 years)-peptic  ulcer disease in males and menorrhagia or 
                 pregnancy in females 
           4.   Elderly-colon   polyps/carcinoma in the Western world; hookworm 
                 (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus) in the developing world 
           5.   Other causes include malnutrition, malabsorption, and gastrectomy (acid aids 
                 iron absorption by maintaining the Fe'+ state, which is more readily absorbed 
                 than Fe3    
     )   Stages of iron deficiency 
           1.   Storage iron is depleted-..J.. ferritin; W  TIBC 
           2.   Serum iron is depleted-..J.. serum iron; ..J.. %saturation 
           3.   Normocytic anemia-Bone   marrow makes fewer, but normal-sized, RBCs. 
           4.   Microcytic,  hypochromic anemia-Bone  marrow makes smaller and fewer 
                 RBCs. 
     G.  Clinical  features of iron deficiency include anemia, koilonychia, and pica. 
     H.  Laboratory findings include 
           1.   Microcytic,  hypochromic RBCs with W  red cell distribution width (RDW, Fig. 
                 5.1) 
           2.   ..J.. ferritin; W  TIBC; ..J.. serum iron; ..J.. % saturation 
           3.   W  Free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) 
     ,   Treatment   involves supplemental iron (ferrous sulfate). 
     J.   Plummer-Vinson syndrome is iron deficiency anemia with esophageal web and 
           atrophic glossitis; presents with anemia, dysphagia, and beefy-red tongue 


,,,  ANEMIA   OF CHRONIC  DISEASE 
     A.   Anemia associated with chronic inflammation (e.g., endocarditis or autoimmune 
           conditions) or cancer; most common type of anemia in hospitalized patients 
     B.   Chronic disease results in production of acute phase reactants from the liver, 
           including  hepcidin. 
           1.   Hepcidin sequesters iron in storage sites by     limiting iron transfer from 
                 macrophages to erythroid precursors and (2) suppressing erythropoietin (EPO)

           subset of patients, especially those with cancer. 


IV. SIDEROBLASTIC  ANEMIA 
     A.   Anemia due to defective protoporphyrin  synthesis 
           1.   ..!-protoporphyrin--+  ..!- heme--+ ..!-hemoglobin--+ microcytic anemia 
     B.   Protoporphyrin  is synthesized via a series of reactions. 
            1.  Aminolevulinic   acid synthetase (ALAS) converts succinyl CoA to 
                 aminolevulinic  acid (ALA)  using vitamin  B6 as a cofactor (rate-limiting step). 
           2.   Aminolevulinic   acid dehydrogenase (ALAD) converts ALA to porphobilinogen. 
           3.   Additional  reactions convert porphobilinogen  to protoporphyrin. 
           4.   Ferrochelatase attaches protoporphyrin to iron to make heme (final reaction; 
                 occurs in the mitochondria). 
      C.  Iron is transferred to erythroid  precursors and enters the mitochondria to form 
           heme. If protoporphyrin   is deficient, iron remains trapped in mitochondria. 
            1.  Iron-laden  mitochondria  form a ring around the nucleus of erythroid  precursors; 
                 these cells are called ringed sideroblasts (hence, the term sideroblastic anemia, 
                 Fig. 5.2). 
      D.  Sideroblastic anemia can be congenital or acquired. 
            ,   Congenital  defect most commonly involves ALAS (rate-limiting   enzyme). 
           2.   Acquired  causes include 
                 i.    Alcoholism-mitochondrial      poison 
                 ii.   Lead poisoning-inhibits     ALAD  and ferrochelatase 
                 iii.   Vitamin  B6 deficiency- required  cofactor for ALAS; most commonly  seen as 
                       a side effect of isoniazid treatment for tuberculosis 
      E.  Laboratory findings  include W  ferritin, ..!- TIBC, W  serum iron, and W  %saturation 
            (iron-overloaded state). 


V.  THALASSEMIA 
      A.  Anemia due to decreased synthesis of the globin chains of hemoglobin 
            1.  ..!-globin --+ ..!- hemoglobin--+ microcytic anemia 
      B.  Inherited  mutation; carriers are protected against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. 
      C.  Divided into  a- and                        based on decreased production of alpha or beta 
           globin  chains.

                                                MACROCYTIC     ANEMIA 

I.   BASIC  PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Anemia with MCV  > 100 flm 3; most commonly due to folate or vitamin Bl2 
           deficiency (megaloblastic anemia) 
     B.   Folate and vitamin Bl2 are necessary for synthesis of DNA precursors. 
           1.   Folate circulates in the serum as methyltetrahydrofolate (methyl THF); removal 
                 of the methyl group allows for participation  in the synthesis of DNA precursors. 
           2.   Methyl group is transferred to vitamin  Bl2  (cobalamin). 
           3.   Vitamin  Bl2 then transfers it to homocysteine, producing methionine. 
     C.   Lack of folate or vitamin Bl2 impairs  synthesis of DNA precursors. 
           1.   Impaired division  and enlargement ofRBC precursors leads to megaloblastic 
                 anemia. 
           2.   Impaired division  of granulocytic  precursors leads to hypersegmented 
                 neutrophils. 
           3.   Megaloblastic change is also seen in rapidly-dividing (e .g., intestinal) epithelial 
                 cells. 
      D.  Other causes of macrocytic anemia (without megaloblastic change) include 
           alcoholism, liver disease, and drugs (e .g., 5-FU). 


II.   FOLATE DEFICIENCY 
      A.  Dietary folate is obtained from green vegetables and some fruits. 
           1.   Absorbed in the jejunum 
      B.  Folate deficiency develops within months, as body stores are minimal. 
     C.   Causes include poor diet (e.g., alcoholics and elderly), increased demand (e .g., 
           pregnancy, cancer, and hemolytic anemia), and folate antagonists (e.g., methotrexate, 
           which inhibits  dihydrofolate  reductase). 
      D.  Clinical and laboratory findings  include 
            I.   Macrocytic  RBCs and hypersegmented neutrophils (> 5 lobes, Fig. 5.5) 
           2.   Glossitis 
           3.   .l. serum folate 
           4.   t  serum homocysteine (increases risk for thrombosis) 
           5.   Normal  methylmalonic acid 


III.  VITAMIN   Bl2  DEFICIENCY 
      A.  Dietary vitamin  Bl2  is complexed to animal-derived proteins. 
           1.   Salivary gland enzymes (e.g. , amylase) liberate vitamin Bl2, which is then bound 
                 by R-binder (also from the salivary gland) and carried through the stomach. 
           2.   Pancreatic proteases in the duodenum detach vitamin Bl2 from R-binder. 
           3.   Vitamin  Bl2  binds intrinsic factor  (made by gastric parietal cells) in the small 
                 bowel; the intrinsic  factor-vitamin  Bl2 complex is absorbed in the ileum. 
      B.  Vitamin  Bl2 deficiency is less common than folate deficiency and takes years to 
           develop due to large hepatic stores of vitamin Bl2. 
     C.   Pernicious anemia is the most common cause of vitamin Bl2 deficiency. 
           1.   Autoimmune  destruction of parietal cells (body of stomach) leads to intrinsic 
                 factor deficiency 
      D.  Other causes of vitamin Bl2 deficiency include pancreatic insufficiency and 
           damage to the terminal ileum (e.g., Crohn disease or Diphyllobothrium latum [fish 
           tapeworm)); dietary deficiency is rare, except in vegans. 
      E.  Clinical  and laboratory findings include 
            l.   Macrocytic  RBCs with hypersegmented neutrophils 
           2.   Glossitis 
           3.   Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord 

53
                 i.    Vitamin  B12 is a cofactor for the conversion of methylmalonic acid to 
                      succinyl CoA  (important  in fatty acid metabolism). 
                 ii.   Vitamin  B12 deficiency results in increased levels of methylmalonic acid, 
                      which  impairs spinal cord myelinization. 
                 iii.  Damage results in poor proprioception and vibratory  sensation (posterior 
                       column) and spastic paresis (lateral corticospinal tract). 
           4.   .J.. serum vitamin B12 
           5.   t  serum homocysteine (similar to folate deficiency), which increases risk for 
                 thrombosis 
           6.   t  methyl malonic acid (unlike folate deficiency) 



                                                NORMOCYTIC      ANEMIA 

I.   BASIC  PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Anemia with  normal-sized RBCs (MCV = 80-100 flm 3) 
     B.   Due to increased peripheral destruction or underproduction 
           1.   Reticulocyte count helps to distinguish between these two etiologies. 


II.   RETICULOCYTES 
     A.   Young RBCs released from the bone marrow 
           1.   Identified  on blood smear as larger cells with bluish cytoplasm (due to residual 
                 RNA, Fig. 5.6) 
     B.   Normal  reticulocyte count (RC) is 1-2%. 
            1.  RBC lifespan is 120 days; each day roughly 1-2% ofRBCs are removed from 
                 circulation  and replaced by reticulocytes. 
      C.  A properly functioning  marrow  responds to anemia by increasing the RC to >3%. 
      D.  RC, however, is falsely elevated in anemia. 
            1.  RC is measured as percentage of total RBCs; decrease in total RBCs falsely 
                 elevates percentage of reticulocytes. 
      E.  RC is corrected by multiplying reticulocyte  count by Hct/45. 
            1.  Corrected count > 3% indicates good marrow response and suggests peripheral 
                 destruction. 
            2.  Corrected count < 3% indicates poor marrow response and suggests 
                 underproduction. 


III.  PERIPHERAL  RBC DESTRUCTION   (HEMOLYSIS) 
      A.  Divided  into extravascular and intravascular hemolysis; both result in anemia with a 
            good marrow response. 
      B.  Extravascular hemolysis involves RBC destruction by the reticuloendothelial system 
            (macrophages of the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes).

54
           1.   Macro phages consume RBCs and break down hemoglobin. 
                 i.    Globin is broken down into amino  acids. 
                 ii.   Heme is broken down into iron  and protoporphyrin;  iron is recycled. 
                 iii.  Protoporphyrin   is broken down into unconjugated bilirubin,  which  is bound 
                       to serum albumin and delivered to the liver for conjugation and excretion 
                       into bile. 
           2.   Clinical  and laboratory findings include 
                 i.    Anemia with  splenomegaly, jaundice due to unconjugated bilirubin, and 
                       increased risk for bilirubin  gallstones 
                 ii.   Marrow  hyperplasia with corrected reticulocyte  count > 3% 
     C.  Intravascular  hemolysis involves destruction of RBCs within vessels . 
           1.   Clinical  and laboratory findings include 
                 i.    Hemoglobinemia 
                 ii.   Hemoglobinuria 
                 iii.  Hemosiderinuria- Renal   tubular  cells pick up some of the hemoglobin that 
                       is filtered into the urine  and break it down into iron, which  accumulates as 
                       hemosiderin; tubular cells are eventually shed resulting in hemosiderinuria. 
                 iv.  Decreased serum haptoglobin 


                        NORMOCYTIC      ANEMIAS    WITH    PREDOMINANT 

                                         EXTRAVASCULAR       HEMOLYSIS 

I.   HEREDITARY   SPHEROCYTOSIS 
     A.   Inherited defect ofRBC  cytoskeleton-membrane tethering proteins 
           1.   Most commonly  involves spectrin, ankyrin,  or band 3.1 
     B.   Membrane blebs are formed and lost over time. 
           1.   Loss of membrane renders cells round (spherocytes) instead of disc-shaped. 
           2.   Spherocytes are less able to maneuver through splenic sinusoids and are 
                 consumed by splenic macrophages, resulting in anemia. 
     C.   Clinical and laboratory  findings include 
            1.  Spherocytes with loss of central pallor (Fig. 5. 7) 
           2.   t  RDW  and t  mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 
           3.   Splenomegaly, jaundice with unconjugated bilirubin,  and increased risk for 
                 bilirubin   gallstones (extravascular hemolysis) 
           4.   Increased risk for aplastic crisis with parvovirus  B19 infection of erythroid 
                 precursors 
     D.   Diagnosed by osmotic fragility test, which reveals increased spherocyte fragility in 
           hypotonic  solution 
     E.   Treatment is splenectomy; anemia resolves, but spherocytes persist and Howell-Jolly 
           bodies (fragments of nuclear material in RBCs) emerge on blood smear (Fig. 5.8) . 


II.   SICKLE CELL  ANEMIA 
      A.  Autosomal recessive mutation       chain of hemoglobin;  a single amino acid change 
           replaces normal glutamic acid (hydrophilic)  with  valine (hydrophobic). 
     B.   Gene is carried by 10% of individuals of African descent, likely due to protective role 
           against falciparum  malaria. 
      C.  Sickle cell disease arises when two abnormal genes are present; results in >90% 
           HbS inRBCs 
      D.  HbS polymerizes when deoxygenated; polymers aggregate into needle-like 
           structures,  resulting in sickle cells (Fig. 5.9). 
            1.  Increased risk of sickling occurs with  hypoxemia, dehydration, and acidosis. 
           2.   HbF protects against sickling; high HbF  at birth is protective for  the first few 
                 months of life. Treatment with  hydroxyurea  increases levels of HbF. 

55
                                                           E.  Cells continuously sickle and de-sickle while passing through the microcirculation, 
                                                                 resulting in complications related to RBC membrane damage. 
                                                                 1.  Extravascular hemolysis-Reticuloendothelial   system removes RBCs with 
                                                                      damaged membranes, leading to anemia, jaundice with unconjugated 
                                                                      hyperbilirubinemia,   and increased risk for bilirubin gallstones. 
                                                                2.   Intravascular  hemolysis-RBCs  with damaged membranes dehydrate, leading to 
                                                                      hemolysis with decreased haptoglobin and target cells on blood smear. 
                                                                3.   Massive erythroid hyperplasia ensues resulting in 
                                                                      i.    Expansion of hematopoiesis into the skull ('crewcut' appearance on x-ray) 
                                                                            and facial bones ('chipmunk facies ') 
                                                                      ii.    Extramedullary hematopoiesis with hepatomegaly 
                                                                      iii.   Risk of aplastic crisis with parvovirus Bl9 infection  of erythroid  precursors 
                                                           F.  Irreversible sickling  leads to complications of vasa-occlusion. 
                                                                 1.  Dactylitis-swollen    hands and feet due to vasa-occlusive infarcts in bones; 
                                                                      common presenting sign in infants 
                                                                 2.  Autosplenectomy- shrunken,   fibrotic spleen. Consequences include 
                                                                      i.    Increased risk of infection with  encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus 
                                                                            pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae (most common cause of death in 
                                                                            children);  affected children should be vaccinated by 5 years of age. 
                                                                       ii .  Increased risk of Salmonella paratyphi osteomyelitis 
                                                                       iii.  Howell-Jolly bodies on blood smear 
                                                                 3.   Acute chest syndrome-vasa-occlusion in  pulmonary microcirculation 
                                                                       i.    Presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and lung infiltrates 
                                                                       ii.   Often precipitated by pneumonia

                                                                 4.   Pain crisis

     A.   Autosomal recessive mutation       chain of hemoglobin 
           1.   Normal  glutamic acid is replaced by lysine. 
           2.   Less common than sickle cell disease 
      B.  Presents with mild anemia due to extravascular hemolysis 
      C.  Characteristic HbC crystals are seen in RBCs on blood smear (Fig. 5.10).

                                         INTRAVASCULAR        HEMOLYSIS 

I.    PAROXYSMAL  NOCTURNAL    HEMOGLOBINURIA     (PNH) 
      A.  Acquired defect in myeloid stem cells resulting in absent 
           glycosylphosphatidylinositol  (GPI); renders cells susceptible to destruction by 
           complement 
            1.  Blood cells coexist with complement. 
           2.   Decay accelerating factor (DAF) on the surface of blood cells protects against 
                 complement-mediated damage by inhibiting  C3 convertase. 
            3.  DAF  is secured to the cell membrane by GPI (an anchoring protein). 
           4.   Absence of GPI leads to absence of DAF, rendering cells susceptible to 
                 complement-mediated damage. 
      B.  Intravascular  hemolysis occurs episodically, often at night during sleep. 
            1.  Mild  respiratory  acidosis develops with shallow breathing during sleep and 
                 activates complement. 
            2.  RBCs, WBCs, and platelets are lysed. 
            3.  Intravascular  hemolysis leads to hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria 
                 (especially in the morning);  hemosiderinuria  is seen days after hemolysis. 
      C.  Sucrose test is used to screen for disease; confirmatory test is the acidified serum test 
            or flow cytometry  to detect lack of CD 55 (DAF) on blood cells. 
      D.  Main  cause of death is thrombosis of the hepatic, portal, or cerebral veins. 
            I.    Destroyed platelets release cytoplasmic contents into circulation, inducing 
                  thrombosis. 
      E.  Complications  include iron deficiency anemia (due to chronic loss of hemoglobin in 
            the urine) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which  develops in 10% of patients. 


II.   GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE   DEHYDROGENASE   (G6PD) DEFICIENCY 
      A.  X-linked  recessive disorder resulting in reduced half-life ofG6PD;  renders cells 
            susceptible to oxidative stress 
            1.   RBCs are normally exposed to oxidative stress, in particular H20 2 

            2.   Glutathione (an antioxidant)  neutralizes H,Q,, but becomes oxidized in the 
                 process. 
            3.  NADPH,  a by-product of G6PD, is needed to regenerate reduced glutathione. 
            4.  ..[, G6PD    ..[, NADPH      ..[,reduced                        oxidative injury  by H20 2 
                  intravascular hemolysis 
      B.  G6PD deficiency has two major variants. 
            1.   African variant- mildly    reduced half-life  of G6PD leading to mild intravascular 
                  hemolysis with oxidative stress 
            2.   Mediterranean variant-markedly    reduced half-life ofG6PD  leading to  marked 
                  intravascular hemolysis with oxidative stress 
            3.   High carrier  frequency in both populations is likely  due to protective role against 
                  falciparum malaria.

                                                          C.   Oxidative stress precipitates Hb as Heinz bodies. 
                                                                l.    Causes of oxidative stress include infections, drugs (e.g., primaquine, sulfa drugs, 
                                                                      and dapsone), and fava beans. 
                                                                2.   Heinz bodies are removed from RBCs by splenic macrophages, resulting in bite 
                                                                      cells (Fig. 5.11) . 
                                                                3.   Leads to predominantly intravascular hemolysis 
                                                          D.   Presents with hemoglobinuria and back pain hours after exposure to oxidative stress 
                                                          E.   Heinz preparation is used to screen for disease (precipitated hemoglobin can only 
                                                                be seen with a special Heinz stain, Fig. 5.12); enzyme studies confirm deficiency 
                                                                (performed weeks after hemolytic episode resolves). 


                                                     III.  IMMUNE   HEMOLYTIC   ANEMIA   (IHA) 
                                                          A.   Antibody-mediated (IgG or  IgM) destruction ofRBCs 
                                                           B.  IgG-mediated disease usually involves extravascular hemolysis. 
                                                                 l.   IgG binds RBCs in the relatively warm temperature of the central body (warm 
                                                                      agglutinin);  membrane of antibody-coated RBC is consumed by splenic 
                                                                      macrophages, resulting in spherocytes. 
                                                                2.   Associated with SLE (most common cause), CLL, and certain drugs (classically, 
                                                                      penicillin  and cephalosporins) 
                                                                      i.    Drug  may attach to RBC membrane (e.g. , penicillin) with subsequent 
                                                                            binding of antibody  to drug-membrane complex 
                                                                      ii.   Drug  may induce production of autoantibodies (e.g. , a-methyldopa) that bind 
                                                                            self antigens on RBCs 
                                                                3.   Treatment involves cessation of the offending drug, steroids, IVIG, and, if 
                                                                      necessary, splenectomy. 
                                                           C.  IgM-mediated disease usually involves intravascular hemolysis. 
                                                                 l.   IgM  binds RBCs and fixes complement in the relatively cold temperature of the 
                                                                      extremities (cold agglutinin). 
                                                                2.   Associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and infectious mononucleosis 
                                                           D.  Coombs test is used to diagnose IHA; testing can be direct or indirect. 
                                                                 l.    Direct Coombs test confirms the presence of antibody-coated RBCs. Anti-IgG 
                                                                      is added to patient RBCs; agglutination occurs ifRBCs are already coated with 
                                                                      antibody. This is the most important test for IHA. 
                                                                 2.  Indirect  Coombs test confirms the presence of antibodies in patient serum. Anti-
                                                                      IgG and test RBCs are mixed with the patient serum; agglutination occurs if 
                                                                      serum antibodies are present. 


                                                     IV. MICROANGIOPATHIC     HEMOLYTIC   ANEMIA 
                                                           A.  Intravascular hemolysis that results from vascular pathology; RBCs are destroyed as 
                                                                 they pass through the circulation.

           1.   Iron deficiency anemia occurs with chronic hemolysis. 
     B.   Occurs with microthrombi   (TTP-HUS, DIC, HELLP), prosthetic  heart valves, and 
           aortic stenosis; microthrombi  produce schistocytes on blood smear (Fig. 5.13). 


V.  MALARIA 
     A.   Infection ofRBCs  and liver with  Plasmodium (Fig. 5.14); transmitted by the female 
           Anopheles mosquito 
     B.   RBCs rupture as a part of the Plasmodium life cycle, resulting in intravascular 
           hemolysis and cyclical fever. 
           1.   P Jalciparum-daily   fever 
           2.   P vivax and P ovale-fever  every other day 
     C.  Spleen also consumes some infected RBCs; results in mild extravascular hemolysis 
           with  splenomegaly 



                                ANEMIA     DUE  TO  UNDERPRODUCTION 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Decreased production of RBCs by bone marrow; characterized by low corrected 
           reticulocyte  count 
      B.  Etiologies include 
           1.   Causes of microcytic and macrocytic anemia 
           2.   Renal failure- decreased production  of EPO by peritubular interstitial  cells 
           3.   Damage to bone marrow precursor cells (may result in anemia or pancytopenia) 


II.   PARVOVIRUS  819 
     A.   Infects progenitor red cells and temporarily halts erythropoiesis; leads to significant 
           anemia in the setting of preexisting marrow  stress (e.g., sickle cell anemia). 
      B.  Treatment is supportive (infection is self-limited). 


III.  APLASTIC  ANEMIA 
      A.  Damage to hematopoietic stem cells, resulting in pancytopenia (anemia, 
           thrombocytopenia,  and leukopenia) with low  reticulocyte count 
      B.  Etiologies include drugs or chemicals, viral infections, and autoimmune damage. 
      C.  Biopsy reveals an empty, fatty marrow (Fig. 5.15). 
      D.  Treatment includes cessation of any causative drugs and supportive care with 
           transfusions and marrow-stimulating   factors (e.g., erythropoietin, GM-CSF, and 
           G-CSF). 
            l.   Immunosuppression may be helpful as some idiopathic cases are due to 
                 abnormal T-cell activation  with release of cytokines. 
           2.   May require bone marrow transplantation  as a last resort

IV. MYELOPHTHISIC    PROCESS 
     A.   Pathologic process (e .g., metastatic cancer) that replaces bone marrow; 
           hematopoiesis is impaired, resulting in pancytopenia.

                                LEUKOPENIA  AND  LEUKOCYTOSIS 

I.   BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A. Hematopoiesis occurs via a stepwise maturation of CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells 
          (Fig. 6.1). 
     B.  Cells mature and are released from the bone marrow into the blood. 
     C. A normal white blood cell (WBC) count is approximately 5-10 K/f!L. 
          l.   A low WBC count(< 5 K) is called leukopenia. 
          2.  A high WBC count (> 10 K) is called leukocytosis. 
          3.  A low or high WBC count is usually due to a decrease or increase in one 
               particular cell lineage. 


II.  LEUKOPENIA 
     A.  Neutropenia refers to a decreased number of circulating neutrophils. Causes include 
          l.   Drug toxicity (e.g., chemotherapy with alkylating agents)-Damage to stem cells 
               results in decreased production of WBCs, especially neutrophils. 
          2.  Severe infection (e.g., gram-negative sepsis)-Increased movement of neutrophils 
               into tissues results in decreased circulating neutrophils. 
          3.  GM-CSF or G-CSF may be used pharmacologically to boost granulocyte 
               production, thereby decreasing risk of infection. 
     B.  Lymphopenia refers to a decreased number of circulating lymphocytes. Causes 
          include 
          l.    Immunodeficiency (e.g., DiGeorge syndrome or HIV) 
          2.  High cortisol state (e.g., exogenous corticosteroids or Cushing syndrome)-
               induces apoptosis oflymphocytes 
          3.  Autoimmune destruction (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus) 
          4.  Whole body radiation-Lymphocytes are highly sensitive to radiation; 
               lymphopenia is the earliest change to emerge after whole body radiation. 


III. LEUKOCYTOSIS 
     A.  Neutrophilic leukocytosis refers to increased circulating neutrophils. Causes include 
          1.  Bacterial infection or tissue necrosis-induces release of marginated pool and 
               bone marrow neutrophils, including immature forms (left shift); immature cells 
               are characterized by decreased Fe receptors (CD16) .

           2.   High cortisol state-impairs   leukocyte adhesion, leading to release of 
                 marginated pool of neutrophils 
     B.  Monocytosis refers to increased circulating monocytes. Causes include chronic 
           inflammatory  states (e.g., autoimmune and infectious) and malignancy. 
     C.  Eosinophilia refers to increased circulating eosinophils. Causes include allergic 
           reactions (type I hypersensitivity), parasitic infections, and Hodgkin lymphoma. 
           Eosinophilia is driven by increased eosinophil chemotactic factor. 
     D.  Basophilia refers to increased circulating basophils; classically seen in chronic 
           myeloid leukemia 
     E.   Lymphocytic leukocytosis refers to increased circulating lymphocytes. Causes 
           include 
           1.   Viral infections-T    lymphocytes undergo hyperplasia in response to virally 
                 infected cells. 
           2.   Bordetella pertussis infection-Bacteria produce lymphocytosis-promoting 
                 factor, which blocks circulating lymphocytes from leaving the blood to enter the 
                 lymph node. 


IV. INFECTIOUS  MONONUCLEOSIS   (IM) 
     A.   EBV infection that results in a lymphocytic leukocytosis comprised of reactive CDS+ 
           T cells; CMV is a less common cause. 
           1.   EBV is transmitted by saliva ("kissing disease"); classically affects teenagers 
     B.   EBV primarily infects 
           1.   Oropharynx, resulting in  pharyngitis 
           2.   Liver, resulting in hepatitis with hepatomegaly and elevated liver enzymes 
           3.   B cells 
     C.  CDS+ T-cell response leads to 
           1.   Generalized lymphadenopathy (LAD) due to T-cell hyperplasia in the lymph 
                 node paracortex 
           2.   Splenomegaly due to T-cell hyperplasia in the periarterial lymphatic sheath 
                 (PALS) 
           3.   High WBC count with  atypical lymphocytes (reactive CDS+ T cells) in the blood 
                 (Fig. 6.2) 
     D.  The monospot test is used for screening. 
           1.   Detects IgM antibodies that cross-react with horse or sheep red blood cells

           2.   Usually turns positive within  l  week after infection 
           3.   A negative monospot test suggests CMV as a possible cause of IM. 
           4.   Definitive diagnosis is made by serologic testing for the EBV viral capsid 
                 antigen.

     E.   Complications 
           I.    Increased risk for splenic rupture (Fig. 6.3); patients are generally advised to 
                 avoid contact sports for one year. 
           2.   Rash if exposed to ampicillin 
           3.   Dormancy of virus  in B cells leads to increased risk for both recurrence and 
                 B-celllymphoma,  especially if immunodeficiency  (e.g., HIV) develops. 



                                                     ACUTE   LEUKEMIA 

I.   BASIC  PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Neoplastic proliferation of blasts; defined as the accumulation of> 20% blasts in the 
           bone marrow. 
     B.   Increased blasts "crowd-out" normal hematopoiesis, resulting in an "acute" 
           presentation with anemia (fatigue), thrombocytopenia  (bleeding), or neutropenia 
           (infection). 
     C.   Blasts usually enter the blood stream, resulting in a high WBC count. 
           1.   Blasts are large, immature cells, often with punched out nucleoli (Fig. 6.4). 
     D.   Acute leukemia is subdivided into acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute 
           myelogenous leukemia (AML) based on the phenotype of the blasts. 


II . ACUTE  LYMPHOBLASTIC    LEUKEMIA 
      A.  Neoplastic accumulation oflymphoblasts  (> 20%) in the bone marrow 
           1.   Lymphoblasts are characterized by positive nuclear staining for TdT, a DNA 
                 polymerase. 
           2.   TdT is absent in myeloid blasts and mature lymphocytes. 
      B.  Most commonly arises in children; associated with Down syndrome (usually arises 
           after the age of 5 years) 
     C.   Subclassified into B-ALL and T-ALL based on surface markers 
      D.  B-ALL is the most common type of ALL. 
           1.   Usually characterized by lymphoblasts (TdT+) that express CDlO, CD19, and 
                 CD20. 
           2.   Excellent response to chemotherapy; requires prophylaxis to scrotum and CSF 
                 (Fig. 6.5) 
           3.   Prognosis is based on cytogenetic abnormalities. 
                 i.    t(l2;2l)   has a good prognosis; more commonly seen in children 
                 ii.   t(9;22) has a poor prognosis; more commonly seen in adults (Philadelphia+ 
                       ALL) 
      E.  T-ALL is characterized by lymphoblasts (TdT+) that express markers ranging from 
           C02  to CDS (e.g., CD3, CD4, CD?). The blasts do not express COlO.

                                                                     lymphoblastic lymphoma because the malignant cells form a mass) 


                                                    III.  ACUTE MYELOID   LEUKEMIA 
                                                          A.  Neoplastic accumulation of myeloblasts (> 20%) in the bone marrow 
                                                          B.  Myeloblasts are usually characterized by positive cytoplasmic staining for 
                                                                myeloperoxidase (MPO). 
                                                                l.   Crystal aggregates of MPO may be seen as Auer rods (Fig. 6.6). 
                                                          C.  Most commonly arises in older adults (average age is 50-60 years) 
                                                          D.  Subclassified based on cytogenetic abnormalities, lineage of myeloblasts, and surface 
                                                               markers. High-yield subtypes include 
                                                                l.   Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) 
                                                                     i.    Characterized by t(15;17), which involves translocation of the retinoic acid 
                                                                           receptor (RAR) on chromosome 17 to chromosome 15; RAR disruption 
                                                                           blocks maturation and promyelocytes (blasts) accumulate. 
                                                                     ii.   Abnormal  promyelocytes contain numerous primary granules that increase 
                                                                           the risk for DIC. 
                                                                     iii.  Treatment is with all-trans-retinoic  acid (ATRA, a vitamin A derivative), 
                                                                           which binds the altered receptor and causes the blasts to mature (and 
                                                                           eventually die). 
                                                                2.  Acute monocytic leukemia 
                                                                     i.    Proliferation  of monoblasts; usually lack MPO

                                                          E.  AML  may also arise from pre-existing dysplasia (myelodysplastic syndromes), 
                                                                especially with prior exposure to alkylating agents or radiotherapy. 
                                                                l.    Myelodysplastic syndromes usually present with cytopenias, hypercellular bone 
                                                                     marrow, abnormal maturation of cells, and increased blasts(< 20%).

II.  CHRONIC   LYMPHOCYTIC   LEUKEMIA    (CLL) 
     A.   Neoplastic proliferation of na·ive B cells that co-express CDS and CD20; most 
           common leukemia overall 
     B.   Increased lymphocytes and smudge cells are seen on blood smear (Fig. 6.8). 
     C.   Involvement of lymph nodes leads to generalized lymphadenopathy and is called 
           small lymphocytic  lymphoma. 
     D.   Complications include 
           1.   Hypogammaglobulinemia-Infection     is the most common cause of death in 
                 CLL. 
           2.   Autoimmune  hemolytic anemia 
           3.   Transformation  to diffuse large B-celllymphoma  (Richter transformation)-
                 marked clinically  by an enlarging lymph node or spleen 


III.  HAIRY  CELL LEUKEMIA 
     A.   Neoplastic proliferation of mature B cells characterized by hairy cytoplasmic 
           processes (Fig. 6.9) 
     B.   Cells are positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). 
      C.  Clinical features include splenomegaly (due to accumulation of hairy cells in 
           red pulp) and "dry  tap" on bone marrow aspiration (due to marrow fibrosis). 
           Lymphadenopathy is usually absent. 
      D.  Excellent response to 2-CDA (cladribine), an adenosine deaminase inhibitor; 
           adenosine accumulates to toxic levels in neoplastic B cells . 


IV. ADULT  T-CELL  LEUKEMIA/LYMPHOMA      (ATLL) 
      A.  Neoplastic proliferation of mature  CD4 + T cells 
      B.  Associated with HTLV-1; most commonly seen in Japan and the Caribbean 
      C.  Clinical  features include rash (skin  infiltration),   generalized lymphadenopathy 
           with  hepatosplenomegaly, and lytic  (punched-out)  bone lesions with 
           hypercalcemia. 


V.  MYCOSIS  FUNGO IDES 
      A.  Neoplastic proliferation of mature  CD4 + T cells that infiltrate the skin, producing 
           localized skin  rash, plaques, and nodules. Aggregates of neoplastic cells in the 
           epidermis are called Pautrier microabscesses. 
      B.  Cells can spread to involve the blood, producing Sezary syndrome. 
            l.   Characteristic lymphocytes with  cerebriform  nuclei (Sezary cells) are seen on 
                 blood smear (Fig. 6.10).

                            MYELOPROLIFERATIVE        DISORDERS     (MPD) 

I.   BASIC  PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Neoplastic proliferation of mature  cells of myeloid lineage; disease of late adulthood 
           (average age is 50-60 years) 
     B.   Results in high WBC count with  hypercellular bone marrow 
            l.   Cells of all myeloid lineages are increased; classified based on the dominant 
                 myeloid cell produced 
     C.   Complications include 
            l.   Increased risk for hyperuricemia  and gout due to high turnover of cells 
           2.   Progression to marrow fibrosis or transformation  to acute leukemia 


II.   CHRONIC  MYELOID   LEUKEMIA    (CML) 
      A.  Neoplastic proliferation  of mature myeloid cells, especially granulocytes and their 
           precursors; basophils are characteristically increased (Fig. 6.11). 
      B.  Driven  by t(9;22) (Philadelphia chromosome) which generates a BCR-ABL fusion 
           protein  with increased tyrosine kinase activity. 
            1.  First line  treatment is imatinib, which  blocks tyrosine kinase activity. 
      C.  Splenomegaly is common. Enlarging spleen suggests accelerated phase of disease; 
           transformation  to acute leukemia usually follows shortly thereafter. 
            l.    Can transform to AML  (2/3 of cases) or ALL (l/3 of cases) since mutation is in a 
                 pluripotent  stem cell. 
      D.  CML  is distinguished from a leukemoid reaction (reactive neutrophilic leukocytosis) 
            by 
            l.    Negative leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) stain (granulocytes in a 
                 leukemoid reaction are LAP positive) 
            2.  Increased basophils (absent with leukemoid reaction) 
            3.  t(9;22) (absent in leukemoid reaction) 


III.  POLYCYTHEMIA    VERA  (PV) 

      A.  Neoplastic proliferation  of mature myeloid cells, especially RBCs 
            1.  Granulocytes and platelets are also increased. 
      B.  Associated with JAK2 kinase mutation 
      C.  Clinical  symptoms are mostly due to hyperviscosity of blood. 
            1.   Blurry vision and headache 
            2.  Increased risk of venous thrombosis (e .g., hepatic vein, portal vein, and dural 
                 sinus) 
            3.   Flushed face due to congestion (plethora) 
            4.  Itching,  especially after bathing (due to histamine release from increased mast 
                 cells) 
      D.  Treatment is phlebotomy; second-line therapy is hydroxyurea.

           l.    Without  treatment, death usually occurs within one year. 
     E.   PV must be distinguished from reactive polycythemia. 
           l.    In PV, erythropoietin  (EPO) levels are decreased, and Sao, is normal. 
           2.   In reactive polycythemia due to high altitude or lung disease, Sao2 is low, and 
                 EPO is increased. 
           3.   In reactive polycythemia due to ectopic EPO production from renal cell 
                 carcinoma, EPO is high, and Sao2 is normal. 


IV. ESSENTIAL  THROMBOCYTHEMIA     (ET) 
     A.   Neoplastic proliferation of mature myeloid cells, especially platelets (Fig. 6.12) 
           l.    RBCs and granulocytes are also increased. 
     B.   Associated with JAK2 kinase mutation 
     C.   Symptoms are related to an increased risk of bleeding and/or thrombosis. 
           l.    Rarely progresses to marrow fibrosis or acute leukemia 
           2.   No significant  risk for hyperuricemia or gout 


V.  MYELOFIBROSIS 
     A.   Neoplastic proliferation of mature myeloid cells, especially megakaryocytes 
            l.   Associated with JAK2 kinase mutation (50% of cases) 
      B.  Megakaryocytes produce excess platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) causing 
           marrow  fibrosis (Fig. 6.13). 
      C.  Clinical features include 
            l.   Splenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis 
           2.   Leukoerythroblastic  smear (tear-drop RBCs, nucleated RBCs, and immature 
                 granulocytes, Fig. 6.14) 
           3.   Increased risk of infection, thrombosis, and bleeding 



                                           LYMPHADENOPATHY         (LAD) 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
      A.  LAD  refers to enlarged lymph nodes. 
            l.   Painful  LAD  is usually seen in lymph nodes that are draining a region of acute 
                 infection  (acute lymphadenitis). 
           2.   Painless LAD can be seen with chronic inflammation (chronic lymphadenitis), 
                 metastatic carcinoma, or lymphoma. 
      B.  In  inflammation, lymph  node enlargement is due to hyperplasia of particular 
            regions of the lymph node (Fig. 6.15). 
            l.    Follicular hyperplasia (B-ee!! region) is seen with rheumatoid arthritis and early 
                 stages ofHIV  infection, for  example.

II.  FOLLICULAR   LYMPHOMA 
     A.   Neoplastic proliferation of small B cells (CD20+) that form follicle-like nodules (Fig. 
           6.16A} 
     B.   Clinically  presents in late adulthood with painless lymphadenopathy 
     C.   Driven by t(l4;18) 
           1.   BCL2 on chromosome 18 translocates to the Ig heavy chain locus on 
                 chromosome 14. 
           2.   Results in overexpression of Bcl2, which inhibits apoptosis 
     D.  Treatment is reserved for patients who are symptomatic and involves low-dose 
           chemotherapy or rituximab  (anti-CD20 antibody}. 
     E.   Progression to diffuse large B-celllymphoma is an important complication; presents 
           as an enlarging lymph node 
     F.   Follicular  lymphoma is distinguished from reactive follicular  hyperplasia by 
           1.   Disruption  of normal lymph  node architecture (maintained in follicular 
                 hyperplasia) 
           2.   Lack of tingible body macrophages in germinal centers (tingible body 
                 macrophages are present in follicular hyperplasia, Fig. 6.16B,C) 
           3.   Bcl2 expression in follicles (not expressed in follicular hyperplasia) 
           4.   Monoclonality  (follicular  hyperplasia is polyclonal) 


III.  MANTLE  CELL  LYMPHOMA 
      A.  Neoplastic proliferation of small B cells (CD20+) that expands the mantle zone 
      B.  Clinically  presents in late adulthood with painless lymphadenopathy 
     C.   Driven by t(ll;l4} 
            1.  Cyclin  D1 gene on chromosome 11 translocates to Ig heavy chain locus on 
                 chromosome 14. 
           2.   Overexpression of cyclin D1 promotes Gl/S transition in the cell cycle, 
                 facilitating  neoplastic proliferation. 


IV. MARGINAL   ZONE  LYMPHOMA 
      A.  Neoplastic proliferation of small B cells (CD20+) that expands the marginal zone 
      B.  Associated with chronic inflammatory  states such as Hashimoto thyroiditis, Sjogren 
           syndrome, and H pylori gastritis 
            1.  The marginal zone is formed by post-germinal center B cells . 
      C.  MALToma is marginal zone lymphoma in mucosal sites.

I.   MULTIPLE   MYELOMA 
     A.   Malignant  proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow 
           1.   Most common primary  malignancy of bone; metastatic cancer, however, is the 
                 most common malignant  lesion of bone overall. 
           2.   High  serum IL-6 is sometimes present; stimulates plasma cell growth and 
                 immunoglobulin   production 
      B.  Clinical  features include 
            1.  Bone pain with hypercalcemia-Neoplastic   plasma cells activate the RANK 
                 receptor on osteoclasts, leading to bone destruction. Lytic, 'punched-out' skeletal 
                 lesions are seen on x-ray (Fig. 6.20A), especially in the vertebrae and skull; 
                 increased risk for fracture 
           2.   Elevated serum protein-Neoplastic   plasma cells produce immunoglobulin; M 
                 spike is present on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), most commonly due to 
                 monoclonal IgG or  IgA. 
           3.   Increased risk of infection-Monoclonal    antibody  lacks antigenic diversity; 
                 infection  is the most common cause of death in multiple myeloma. 
           4.   Rouleaux formation ofRBCs  on blood smear-Increased  serum protein 
                 decreases charge between RBCs (Fig. 6.20B). 
            5.  Primary  AL amyloidosis-Free   light chains circulate in serum and deposit in 
                 tissues. 
           6.   Proteinuria-Free   light  chain is excreted in the urine as Bence Jones protein; 
                 deposition in  kidney tubules leads to risk for renal failure (myeloma kidney). 


II.   MONOCLONAL   GAMMOPATHY   OF UNDETERMINED    SIGNIFICANCE   (MGUS) 
      A.  Increased serum protein with M spike on SPEP; other features of multiple myeloma 
           are absent (e.g., no lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, AL amyloid, or Bence Jones 
           proteinuria). 
      B.  Common in  elderly (seen in 5% of 70-year-old individuals); 1% of patients with 
            MGUS develop multiple myeloma each year. 


Ill.  WALDENSTROM   MACROGLOBULINEMIA 
      A.  B-celllymphoma  with  monoclonal IgM  production

           1.   Generalized lymphadenopathy; lytic bone lesions are absent. 
           2.   Increased serum protein with M spike (comprised oflgM) 
           3.   Visual and neurologic deficits (e.g., retinal hemorrhage or stroke)-lgM  (large 
                 pentamer) causes serum hyperviscosity. 
           4.   Bleeding-Viscous  serum results in defective platelet aggregation. 
     C.  Acute complications are treated with plasmapheresis, which removes IgM from the 
           serum. 



                                   LANGERHANS      CELL  HISTIOCYTOSIS 

I.   BASIC  PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Langerhans cells are specialized dendritic cells found predominantly in the skin. 
           1.   Derived from bone marrow monocytes 
           2.   Present antigen to naive T cells 
     B.   Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a neoplastic proliferation of Langerhans cells. 
           1.   Characteristic Birbeck (tennis racket) granules are seen on electron microscopy 
                 (Fig. 6.21); cells are CDla+ and SlOO+ by immunohistochemistry. 


II.  LETTERER-SIWE   DISEASE 
     A.   Malignant  proliferation ofLangerhans  cells 
     B.   Classic presentation is skin rash and cystic skeletal defects in an infant ( < 2 years old). 
      C.  Multiple organs may be involved; rapidly fatal 


Ill.  EOSINOPHILIC   GRANULOMA 
      A.  Benign proliferation  of Langer hans cells in bone 
      B.  Classic presentation is pathologic fracture in an adolescent; skin is not involved. 
      C.  Biopsy shows Langerhans cells with mixed inflammatory cells, including numerous 
           eosinophils. 


IV. HAND-SCHULLER-CHRISTIAN       DISEASE 
      A.  Malignant  proliferation of Langer hans cells 
      B.  Classic presentation is scalp rash, lytic skull defects, diabetes insipidus, and 
           exophthalmos in a child.

                                                     VASCULITIS 

I.   BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A. Inflammation of the blood vessel wall 
          1.  Arterial wall is comprised of three layers: endothelial intima, smooth muscle 
               media, and connective tissue adventitia (Fig. 7.1). 
     B.  Etiology is usually unknown; most cases are not infectious. 
     C. Clinical features include 
          1.  Nonspecific symptoms of inflammation (e.g., fever, fatigue, weight loss, and 
               myalgias) 
          2.  Symptoms of organ ischemia-due to luminal narrowing or thrombosis of the 
               inflamed vessels 
     D. Divided into large-, medium-, and small-vessel vasculitides 
          1.  Large-vessel vasculitis involves the aorta and its major branches. 
          2.  Medium-vessel vasculitis involves muscular arteries that supply organs. 
          3.  Small-vessel vasculitis involves arterioles, capillaries, and venules. 


II.  LARGE-VESSEL VASCULITIS 
     A.  Temporal (Giant Cell) Arteritis 
          l.   Granulomatous vasculitis that classically involves branches of the carotid artery 
          2.  Most common form of vasculitis in older adults (> 50 years); usually affects 
               females 
          3.  Presents as headache (temporal artery involvement), visual disturbances 
               (ophthalmic artery involvement), and jaw claudication. Flu-like symptoms 
               with joint and muscle pain (polymyalgia rheumatica) are often present. ESR is 
               elevated. 
          4.  Biopsy reveals inflamed vessel wall with giant cells and intimal fibrosis (Fig. 7.2). 
               i.    Lesions are segmental; diagnosis requires biopsy of a long segment of vessel, 
                    and a negative biopsy does not exclude disease. 
          5.  Treatment is corticosteroids; high risk of blindness without treatment 
     B.  Takayasu Arteritis 
          l.   Granulomatous vasculitis that classically involves the aortic arch at branch 
               points 
          2.  Presents in adults < 50 years old (classically, young Asian females) as visual 
               and neurologic symptoms with a weak or absent pulse in the upper extremity 
               ('pulseless disease'). ESR is elevated. 
          3.  Treatment is corticosteroids. 


III. MEDIUM-VESSEL VASCULITIS 
     A.  Polyarteritis Nodosa 
          1.  Necrotizing vasculitis involving multiple organs; lungs are spared. 
          2.  Classically presents in young adults as hypertension (renal artery involvement), 
               abdominal pain with melena (mesenteric artery involvement), neurologic 
               disturbances, and skin lesions. Associated with serum HBsAg

                                                                      inflammation  with  fibrinoid  necrosis (Fig. 7.3); eventually heals with fibrosis, 
                                                                      producing a 'string-of-pearls'  appearance on imaging 
                                                                4.   Treatment is corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide; fatal if not treated 
                                                           B.  Kawasaki Disease 
                                                                 1.  Classically affects Asian children < 4 years old 
                                                                 2.  Presents with nonspecific signs including fever, conjunctivitis, erythematous 
                                                                      rash of palms and soles, and enlarged cervical lymph nodes 
                                                                3.   Coronary  artery involvement is common and leads to risk for (1) thrombosis 
                                                                      with  myocardial infarction  and (2) aneurysm with rupture. 
                                                                 4.  Treatment is aspirin and IVIG;  disease is self-limited. 
                                                           C.  Buerger Disease 
                                                                 1.  Necrotizing  vasculitis involving  digits 
                                                                 2.   Presents with ulceration, gangrene, and autoamputation of fingers and toes; 
                                                                      Raynaud phenomenon is often present. 
                                                                 3.  Highly  associated with heavy smoking; treatment is smoking cessation.

                                                                 1.   Necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis involving  nasopharynx, lungs, and 
                                                                       kidneys 
                                                                 2.   Classic presentation is a middle-aged male with sinusitis or nasopharyngeal 
                                                                       ulceration, hemoptysis with bilateral nodular lung  infiltrates, and hematuria due 
                                                                       to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. 
                                                                 3.  Serum c-ANCA  levels correlate with disease activity. 
                                                                 4.   Biopsy reveals large necrotizing granulomas with adjacent necrotizing vasculitis 
                                                                       (Fig. 7.4). 
                                                                 5.   Treatment is cyclophosphamide and steroids; relapses are common. 
                                                           B.  Microscopic  Polyangiitis 
                                                                 1.   Necrotizing vasculitis involving  multiple  organs, especially lung and kidney 
                                                                 2.   Presentation is similar to Wegener granulomatosis, but nasopharyngeal 
                                                                       involvement and granulomas are absent. 
                                                                 3.   Serum p-ANCA levels correlate with disease activity. 
                                                                 4.   Treatment is corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide; relapses are common.

     D.  Henoch-Schonlein Purpura 
           1.  Vasculitis due to IgA immune  complex deposition; most common vasculitis in 
                 children 
           2.   Presents with palpable purpura on buttocks and legs, GI pain and bleeding, and 
                hematuria  (IgA nephropathy); usually occurs following an upper respiratory 
                tract  infection 
           3.   Disease is self-limited, but may recur; treated with steroids, if severe 



                                                HYPERTENSION      (HTN) 

I.   BASIC  PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Increased blood pressure; may involve pulmonary (see chapter 9) or systemic 
           circulation 
     B.   Systemic HTN is defined as                140/90 mm Hg (normal $  120/80 mm Hg); 
           divided into  primary or  secondary types based on etiology 


II.  PRIMARY   HTN 
     A.   HTN of unknown  etiology (95% of cases) 
     B.   Risk factors include age, race (increased risk in African Americans, decreased risk in 
           Asians), obesity, stress, lack of physical activity, and high-salt diet. 


III. SECONDARY  HTN 
     A.   HTN due to an identifiable etiology (5% of cases) 
     B.   Renal artery stenosis is a common cause (renovascular hypertension). 
           1.   Stenosis decreases blood flow to glomerulus. 
           2.   Juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) responds by secreting renin, which converts 
                 angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. 
           3.   Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II (A Til)  by angiotensin converting 
                 enzyme (ACE). 
           4.   ATII  raises blood pressure by (1) contracting arteriolar smooth muscle, 
                 increasing total peripheral resistance and (2) promoting adrenal release of 
                 aldosterone, which increases resorption of sodium in the distal convoluted 
                 tubule (expanding plasma volume). 
           5.   Leads to HTN with increased plasma renin and unilateral atrophy (due to 
                 low blood flow) of the affected kidney; neither feature is seen in primary 
                 hypertension. 
     C.   Important  causes of stenosis include atherosclerosis (elderly males) and 
           fibromuscular  dysplasia (young females).

                                                                      resulting  in irregular  thickening oflarge- and  medium -sized arteries, especially 
                                                                      the renal artery.

                                                           A.  HTN  can also be classified as benign or malignant. 
                                                           B.  Benign HTN  is a mild or moderate elevation in blood pressure; most cases ofHTN 
                                                                 are benign. 
                                                                 l.    Clinically  silent; vessels and organs are damaged slowly over time. 
                                                           C.  Malignant  HTN  is severe elevation in blood pressure (> 200/120 mm Hg); comprises 
                                                                 < 5% of cases 
                                                                 l.    May arise from preexisting benign HTN  or de novo 
                                                                 2.   Presents with acute end-organ damage (e.g., acute renal failure, headache, and

                                                                                                        ARTERIOSCLEROSIS 

                                                     I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
                                                           A.  Literally,  "hard arteries;" due to thickening of the blood vessel wall 
                                                           B.  Three pathologic patterns-atherosclerosis,  arteriolosclerosis, and Monckeberg 
                                                                 medial calcific sclerosis 


                                                     II.   ATHEROSCLEROSIS 
                                                           A.  Intimal   plaque that obstructs blood flow 
                                                                 l.    Consists of a necrotic lipid core (mostly cholesterol) with a fibromuscular cap 
                                                                       (Fig. 7.5); often undergoes dystrophic calcification 
                                                           B.   Involves large- and medium-sized arteries; abdominal aorta, coronary artery, 
                                                                 popliteal artery, and internal carotid  artery are commonly affected. 
                                                           C.  Risk factors for atherosclerosis are divided into modifiable and non modifiable. 
                                                                 l.    Modifiable risk  factors include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia (LDL 
                                                                       increases risk; HDL decreases risk), smoking, and diabetes. 
                                                                 2.   Non modifiable risk factors include age (number and severity oflesions increase 
                                                                       with age), gender (increased risk in males and postmenopausal females; estrogen 
                                                                       is protective), and genetics (multifactorial, but family history  is highly predictive 
                                                                       of risk). 
                                                           D.  Pathogenesis 
                                                                 l.    Damage to endothelium allows lipids to leak into the intima. 
                                                                 2.   Lipids are oxidized and then consumed by macrophages via scavenger receptors, 
                                                                       resulting in foam cells.

           3.  Inflammation  and healing leads to deposition of extracellular matrix and 
                proliferation  of smooth muscle. 
     E.  Morphologic  stages 
           1.  Begins as fatty streaks (flat yellow lesions of the intima consisting oflipid-laden 
                 macrophages); arise early in life (present in most teenagers) 
           2.   Progresses to atherosclerotic plaque 
     F.   Complications of atherosclerosis account for > 50% of disease in Western countries. 
           l.    Stenosis of medium-sized vessels results in impaired blood flow and ischemia 
                 leading to 
                 i.    Peripheral vascular disease (lower extremity arteries, e.g., popliteal) 
                 ii.   Angina (coronary arteries) 
                 iii.  Ischemic bowel disease (mesenteric arteries) 
           2.   Plaque rupture with thrombosis results in myocardial infarction  (coronary 
                 arteries) and stroke (e .g. , middle cerebral artery). 
           3.   Plaque rupture with embolization results in atherosclerotic emboli, characterized 
                 by cholesterol crystals within the embolus (Fig. 7.6). 
           4.   Weakening of vessel wall results in aneurysm (e .g., abdominal aorta). 


III. ARTERIOLOSCLEROSIS 
     A.   Narrowing of small arterioles; divided into  hyaline and hyperplastic types 
     B.   Hyaline arteriolosclerosis is caused by proteins leaking into the vessel wall, 
           producing vascular thickening; proteins are seen as pink hyaline on microscopy (Fig. 
           7.7). 
           l.    Consequence oflong-standing benign hypertension or diabetes 
           2.   Results in reduced vessel caliber with end-organ ischemia; classically produces 
                 glomerular scarring (arteriolonephrosclerosis, Fig. 7.8) that slowly progresses to 
                 chronic renal failure 
     C.   Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis involves thickening of vessel wall by hyperplasia of 
           smooth muscle ('onion-skin' appearance, Fig. 7.9). 
           l.    Consequence of malignant hypertension 
           2.   Results in reduced vessel caliber with end-organ ischemia 
           3.   May lead to fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall with hemorrhage; classically 
                 causes acute renal failure with a characteristic 'flea-bitten' appearance 


IV. M6NCKEBERG   MEDIAL   CALCIFIC  SCLEROSIS 
      A.  Calcification of the media of muscular (medium-sized) arteries; non obstructive (Fig. 
           7.10A) 
      B.  Not clinically  significant; seen as an incidental finding on x-ray or mammography 
           (Fig. 7.10B)

                                                     I.   AORTIC  DISSECTION 
                                                          A.   Intimal  tear with dissection of blood through media of the aortic wall  (Fig. 7.11) 
                                                          B.   Occurs in the proximal10  em of the aorta (high stress region) with preexisting 
                                                                weakness of the media 
                                                          C.   Most common cause is hypertension (older adults); also associated with inherited 
                                                                defects of connective tissue (younger individuals) 
                                                                 1.  Hypertension results in hyaline arteriosclerosis of the vasa vasorum; decreased 
                                                                      flow causes atrophy of the media. 
                                                                2.   Marfan  syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome classically lead to weakness of 
                                                                      the connective tissue in the media (cystic medial necrosis). 
                                                           D.  Presents as sharp, tearing chest pain that radiates to the back 
                                                           E.  Complications include pericardia! tamponade (most common cause of death), 
                                                                 rupture with fatal hemorrhage, and obstruction of branching arteries (e.g., coronary 
                                                                or renal) with  resultant end-organ ischemia. 


                                                     II.   THORACIC  ANEURYSM 
                                                           A.  Balloon-like  dilation of the thoracic aorta 
                                                           B.  Due to weakness in the aortic wall. Classically seen in tertiary syphilis; endarteritis 
                                                                 of the vasa vasorum results in !urn ina! narrowing, decreased flow, and atrophy of the 
                                                                vessel wall. Results in a 'tree-bark' appearance of the aorta (Fig. 7.12) 
                                                           C.  Major complication  is dilation of the aortic valve root, resulting in aortic valve 
                                                                 insufficiency. 
                                                                 1.  Other  complications include compression of mediastinal structures (e.g., airway 
                                                                      or esophagus) and thrombosis/embolism. 


                                                     III.  ABDOMINAL    AORTIC  ANEURYSM 
                                                           A.  Balloon-like  dilation of the abdominal  aorta; usually arises below the renal arteries, 
                                                                 but above the aortic bifurcation (Fig. 7.13) 
                                                           B.  Primarily  due to atherosclerosis; classically seen in male smokers> 60 years old with 
                                                                 hypertension 
                                                                 1.  Atherosclerosis increases the diffusion barrier to the media, resulting in atrophy 
                                                                      and weakness of the vessel wall. 
                                                           C.  Presents as a pulsatile abdominal mass that grows with time 
                                                           D.  Major complication  is rupture, especially when > 5 em in diameter; presents with 
                                                                 triad of hypotension, pulsatile abdominal mass, and flank pain

                                                  VASCULAR    TUMORS 

I.   HEMANGIOMA 
     A.   Benign tumor comprised of blood vessels (Fig . 7.14) 
     B.   Commonly present at birth; often regresses during childhood 
     C.  Most often involves skin and liver 


II.  ANGIOSARCOMA 
      A.  Malignant proliferation  of endothelial cells; highly aggressive 
      B.  Common sites include skin, breast, and liver. 
           1.   Liver angiosarcoma is associated with exposure to polyvinyl chloride, arsenic, 
                 and Thorotrast. 


Ill.  KAPOSI  SARCOMA 
      A.  Low-grade malignant proliferation  of endothelial cells; associated with HHV-8 
     B.   Presents as purple patches, plaques, and nodules on the skin (Fig. 7.15); may also 
           involve visceral organs 
     C.   Classically seen in 
           1.   Older Eastern European males-tumor  remains localized to skin; treatment 
                 involves surgical removal. 
           2.   AIDS- tumor   spreads early; treatment is antiretroviral agents (to boost immune 
                 system). 
           3.   Transplant recipients-tumor    spreads early; treatment involves decreasing 
                 immunosuppression.

                            Cardiac                   Pathology 







                                 ISCHEMIC  HEART  DISEASE (IHD) 

I.   BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A. Group of syndromes related to myocardial ischemia; IHD is the leading cause of 
          death in the US. 
     B. Usually due to atherosclerosis of coronary arteries, which decreases blood flow to the 
          myocardium 
          1.  Risk factors for IHD are similar to those of atherosclerosis; incidence increases 
               with age. 


II.  ANGINA 
     A. Stable angina is chest pain that arises with exertion or emotional stress. 
          1.  Due to atherosclerosis of coronary arteries with > 70% stenosis; decreased blood 
               flow is not able to meet the metabolic demands of the myocardium during 
               exertion. 
          2.  Represents reversible injury to myocytes (no necrosis) 
          3.  Presents as chest pain (lasting< 20 minutes) that radiates to the left arm or jaw, 
               diaphoresis, and shortness of breath 
          4.  EKG shows ST-segment depression due to subendocardial ischemia. 
          5.  Relieved by rest or nitroglycerin 
     B.  Unstable angina is chest pain that occurs at rest. 
          1.  Usually due to rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque with thrombosis and 
               incomplete occlusion of a coronary artery (Fig. 8.1A). 
          2.  Represents reversible injury to myocytes (no necrosis) 
          3.  EKG shows ST-segment depression due to subendocardial ischemia. 
          4.  Relieved by nitroglycerin 
          5.  High risk of progression to myocardial infarction 
     C. Prinzmetal angina is episodic chest pain unrelated to exertion. 
          1.  Due to coronary artery vasospasm 
          2.  Represents reversible injury to myocytes (no necrosis) 
          3.  EKG shows ST-segment elevation due to transmural ischemia. 
          4.  Relieved by nitroglycerin or calcium channel blockers 


Ill. MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION 
     A.  Necrosis of cardiac myocytes 
     B.  Usually due to rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque with thrombosis and complete 
          occlusion of a coronary artery (Fig. 8.1B) 
          1.  Other causes include coronary artery vasospasm (due to Prinzmetal angina or 
               cocaine use), emboli, and vasculitis (e .g. , Kawasaki disease). 
     C. Clinical features include severe, crushing chest pain (lasting> 20 minutes) that 
          radiates to the left arm or jaw, diaphoresis, and dyspnea; symptoms are not relieved 
          by nitroglycerin. 
     D. Infarction usually involves the left ventricle (LV); right ventricle (RV) and both atria 
          are generally spared.

                                                                 1.  Occlusion ofleft  anterior descending artery (LAD) leads to infarction of the 
                                                                      anterior wall  and anterior septum of the LV; LAD is the most commonly

I.   BASIC  PRINCIPLES 
     A.  Arise  during embryogenesis (usually weeks 3 through 8); seen in 1% oflive births 
           1.   Most defects are sporadic. 
     B.   Often result in shunting between left (systemic) and right (pulmonary) circulations. 
     C.  Defects with left-to-right  shunting may be relatively asymptomatic at birth, but the 
           shunt can eventually reverse. 
           1.   Increased flow through the pulmonary circulation  results in hypertrophy of 
                 pulmonary vessels and pulmonary hypertension. 
           2.   Increased pulmonary resistance eventually results in reversal of shunt, leading 
                 to late cyanosis (Eisenmenger syndrome) with right ventricular hypertrophy, 
                 polycythemia, and clubbing. 
     D.  Defects with right-to-left  shunting usually present as cyanosis shortly after birth. 


II.  VENTRICULAR    SEPTAL DEFECT  (VSD) 
     A.   Defect in the septum that divides the right and left ventricles 
           1.   Most common congenital heart defect 
           2.   Associated with fetal alcohol syndrome 
     B.   Results in left-to-right shunt; size of defect determines extent of shunting and age 
           at presentation. Small defects are often asymptomatic; large defects can lead to 
           Eisenmenger syndrome. 
     C.   Treatment involves surgical closure; small defects may close spontaneously. 


III. ATRIAL   SEPTAL DEFECT  (ASD) 
     A.   Defect in the septum that divides right and left atria; most common type is ostium 
           secundum (90% of cases). 
     B.   Ostium primum  type is associated with Down syndrome. 
                                                                          on auscultation (increased blood in right 
     C.   Results in left-to-right shunt and split S2 
           heart delays closure of pulmonary valve) 
     D.   Paradoxical emboli are an important complication. 


IV. PATENT  DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS  (PDA) 
     A.   Failure of ductus arteriosus to close; associated with congenital rubella 
      B.  Results in left-to-right shunt between the aorta and the pulmonary artery 
           1.   During  development, the ductus arteriosus normally shunts blood from the 
                 pulmonary  artery to the aorta, bypassing the lungs. 
     C.   Asymptomatic at birth with  holosystolic 'machine-like' murmur;  may lead to 
           Eisenmenger syndrome, resulting in lower extremity cyanosis 
     D.   Treatment involves indomethacin, which decreases PGE, resulting in PDA closure 
           (PGE maintains patency of the ductus arteriosus). 


V.  TETRALOGY   OF FALLOT 
     A.   Characterized by (1) stenosis of the right ventricular outflow tract, (2) right 
           ventricular  hypertrophy, (3) VSD, and (4) an aorta that overrides the VSD 
     B.   Right-to-left shunt leads to early cyanosis; degree of stenosis determines the extent of 
           shunting and cyanosis. 
     C.   Patients learn to squat in response to a cyanotic spell; increased arterial resistance 
           decreases shunting and allows more blood to reach the lungs. 
      D.  'Boot-shaped' heart on x-ray (Fig. 8.10) 


VI. TRANSPOSITION   OF THE  GREAT VESSELS 
     A.   Characterized by pulmonary artery arising from  the left ventricle and aorta arising 
           from  the right ventricle 

85
                                                                         OF  PATHOLOGY 



     B.   Associated with maternal diabetes 
     C.   Presents with early cyanosis; pulmonary and systemic circuits do not mix. 
           1.   Creation of shunt (allowing blood to mix)  after birth  is required for survival. 
           2.   PGE can be administered to maintain a PDA until definitive surgical repair  is 
                 performed. 
     D.   Results in hypertrophy of the right ventricle and atrophy of the left ventricle 


VII. TRUNCUS  ARTERIOSUS 
     A.   Characterized by a single large vessel arising from both ventricles 
           1.   Truncus fails to divide. 
     B.   Presents with early cyanosis; deoxygenated blood from right ventricle mixes with 
           oxygenated blood from left ventricle before pulmonary and aortic circulations 
           separate. 


VIII. TRICUSPID   ATRESIA 
     A.   Tricuspid valve orifice fails to develop; right ventricle is hypoplastic. 
     B.   Often associated with ASD, resulting in a right-to-left shunt; presents with early 
           cyanosis. 


IX. COARCTATION   OF THE  AORTA 
      A.  Narrowing  of the aorta (Fig. S.llA); classically divided into  infantile and adult forms 
      B.  Infantile  form is associated with a PDA; coarctation lies after (distal to) the aortic 
           arch, but before (proximal to) the PDA. 
            1.  Presents as lower extremity cyanosis in infants, often at birth 
           2.   Associated with Turner syndrome 
      C.  Adult form  is not associated with a PDA; coactation lies after (distal to) the aortic 
           arch. 
            1.  Presents as hypertension in the upper extremities and hypotension with weak 
                 pulses in the lower extremities; classically discovered in adulthood 
           2.   Collateral circulation  develops across the intercostal arteries; engorged arteries 
                 cause 'notching' of ribs on x-ray (Fig. S.llB). 
            3.  Associated with bicuspid aortic valve 



                                                VALVULAR     DISORDERS 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
      A.  The heart has four valves (tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic) that prevent 
            backtlow. 
      B.  Valvular  lesions generally result in stenosis (decreased caliber of the valve orifice) or 
            regurgitation (backtlow).

             Aliya Husain, MD. 8, Courtesy of Images PaediatrCardio/2009;38:7- 9) 

86
II.  ACUTE  RHEUMATIC    FEVER 
     A.   Systemic complication of pharyngitis due to group A                     streptococci; 
           affects children 2- 3 weeks after an episode of streptococcal pharyngitis ("strep 
           throat") 
     B.   Caused by molecular mimicry; bacterial M protein  resembles proteins in human 
           tissue. 
     C.   Diagnosis is based on jones criteria. 
            l.   Evidence of prior group A                     streptococcal infection  (e.g., elevated 
                 ASO or anti-DNase B titers) with the presence of major and minor criteria 
           2.   Minor  criteria  are nonspecific and include fever and elevated ESR. 
           3.   Major  criteria 
                 i.    Migratory  polyarthritis-swelling     and pain in  a large joint (e.g., wrist, knees, 
                       ankles) that resolves within days and "migrates" to involve another large 
                       joint 
                 i i.   Pancarditis 
                       a.   Endocarditis-Mitral     valve is involved more commonly than the aortic 
                             valve. Characterized by small vegetations along lines of closure that lead 
                             to regurgitation  (Fig. 8.12A) 
                       b.   Myocarditis  with Aschoff bodies that are characterized by foci of chronic 
                             inflammation,  reactive histiocytes with slender, wavy nuclei (Anitschkow 
                             cells), giant cells, and fibrinoid material (Fig. 8.12B,C); myocarditis is the 
                             most common cause of death during the acute phase. 
                       c.   Pericarditis-leads   to friction  rub  and chest pain 
                 iii.   Subcutaneous nodules 
                 iv.   Erythema marginatum-annular,    nonpruritic   rash with erythematous 
                       borders, commonly involving  trunk  and limbs 
                 v.   Sydenham chorea (rapid, involuntary muscle movements) 
      D.  Acute attack usually resolves, but may progress to chronic rheumatic heart disease; 
            repeat exposure to group A                    streptococci results in relapse of the acute 
            phase and increases risk for chronic disease. 


III.  CHRONIC  RHEUMATIC    HEART  DISEASE 
      A.  Valve scarring that arises as a consequence of rheumatic fever 
      B.  Results in stenosis with a classic 'fish-mouth' appearance 
            l.    Almost always involves the mitral valve; leads to thickening of chordae tendineae 
                  and cusps 
            2.   Occasionally involves the aortic valve; leads to fusion of the commissures (Fig. 
                 8.13) 
            3.   Other valves are less commonly involved. 
      C.  Complications include infectious  endocarditis.

Husain, MD. B, Courtesy of Ed Uthman, MD) 

87
IV. AORTIC  STENOSIS 
     A.   Narrowing ofthe  aortic valve orifice (Fig. 8.14) 
     B.   Usually due to fibrosis and calcification from "wear and tear" 
           1.   Presents in late adulthood (> 60 years) 
           2.   Bicuspid aortic valve increases risk and hastens disease onset. A normal aortic 
                 valve has three cusps; fewer cusps results in increased "wear and tear" on each 
                 cusp. 
     C.   May also arise as a consequence of chronic rheumatic valve disease; coexisting 
           mitral  stenosis and fusion of the aortic valve commissures distinguish rheumatic 
           disease from "wear and tear." 
     D.   Cardiac compensation leads to a prolonged asymptomatic stage during which a 
           systolic ejection click followed by a crescendo-decrescendo murmur is heard. 
      E.  Complications include 
            1.  Concentric left ventricular  hypertrophy-may   progress to cardiac failure 
           2.   Angina and syncope with exercise-Limited   ability to increase blood flow across 
                 the stenotic valve leads to decreased perfusion of the myocardium and brain. 
           3.   Microangiopathic  hemolytic anemia-RBCs  are damaged (producing 
                 schistocytes) while crossing the calcified valve. 
      F.  Treatment is valve replacement after onset of complications. 


V.  AORTIC  REGURGITATION 
      A.  Backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole 
      B.  Arises due to aortic root dilation (e.g., syphilitic aneurysm and aortic dissection) 
           or valve damage (e .g., infectious endocarditis); most common cause is isolated root 
           dilation 
      C.  Clinical  features include 
            1.  Early, blowing diastolic murmur 
           2.   Hyperdynamic  circulation due to increased pulse pressure 
                 i.    Pulse pressure is the difference between systol ic and diastolic pressures. 
                 ii .   Diastolic pressure decreases due to regurgitation, while systolic pressure 
                       increases due to increased stroke volume. 
                 iii.   Presents with bounding pulse (water-hammer pulse), pulsating nail bed 
                       (Quincke pulse), and head bobbing 
            3.  Results in LV dilation and eccentric hypertrophy (due to volume overload) 
      D.  Treatment i  valve replacement once LV dysfunction develops. 


VI. MITRAL   VALVE  PROLAPSE 
      A.  Ballooning  of mitral valve into left atrium  during systole 
            1.  Seen in 2-3% of US adults

88
     B.   Due to myxoid degeneration (accumulation of ground substance) of the valve, 
           making it  floppy (Fig. 8.15) 
           l.    Etiology is unknown;  may be seen in Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos 
                 syndrome 
     C.  Presents with an incidental mid-systolic  click followed by a regurgitation murmur; 
           usually asymptomatic 
           l.    Click and murmur  become louder with squatting (increased systemic resistance 
                 decreases left ventricular emptying). 
     D.   Complications are rare, but include infectious endocarditis, arrhythmia,  and severe 
           mitral  regurgitation. 
     E.   Treatment is valve replacement. 


VII. MITRAL   REGURGITATION 
     A.   Reflux of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium  during  systole 
     B.   Usually arises as a complication of mitral valve prolapse; other causes include LV 
           dilatation  (e.g., left-sided cardiac failure), infective endocarditis, acute rheumatic 
           heart disease, and papillary muscle rupture after a myocardial infarction. 
     C.   Clinical features 
           l.    Holosystolic "blowing"  murmur;  louder with  squatting (increased systemic 
                 resistance decreases left ventricular emptying) and expiration (increased return 
                 to left atrium) 
           2.   Results in volume overload and left-sided heart failure 


VIII. MITRAL   STENOSIS 
     A.   Narrowing  of the mitral valve orifice 
           l.    Usually due to chronic rheumatic valve disease 
     B.   Clinical  features 

           l.    Opening snap followed by diastolic rumble 
           2.   Volume overload leads to dilatation of the left atrium, resulting in 
                 i.    Pulmonary  congestion with edema and alveolar hemorrhage 
                 ii.   Pulmonary  hypertension and eventual right-sided heart failure 
                 iii.  Atrial  fibrillation   with  associated risk for mural thrombi (Fig. 8.16) 



                                                        ENDOCARDITIS 

I.   BASIC  PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Inflammation  of endocardium that lines  the surface of cardiac valves; usually due to 
           bacterial infection 
     B.   Streptococcus viridans is the most common overall cause. It is a low-virulence 
           organism that infects previously damaged valves (e.g., chronic rheumatic heart

           disease and mitral valve prolapse). Results in small vegetations that do not destroy 
           the valve (subacute endocarditis) 
           1.   Damaged endocardial surface develops thrombotic vegetations (platelets and 
                 fibrin). 
           2.   Transient bacteremia leads to trapping of bacteria in the vegetations; 
                 prophylactic antibiotics decrease risk of endocarditis. 
     C.  Staphylococcus au reus is the most common cause in IV drug abusers. 
           1.   High-virulence  organism that infects normal valves, most commonly the 
                 tricuspid. 
           2.   Results in large vegetations that destroy the valve (acute endocarditis, Fig. 8.17) 
     D.  Staphylococcus epidermidis is associated with endocarditis of prosthetic valves. 
     E.   Streptococcus bovis is associated with endocarditis in patients with underlying 
           colorectal carcinoma. 
     F.   HACEK organisms (Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, 
           Kingella) are associated with endocarditis with negative blood cultures. 
     G.  Clinical  features of bacterial endocarditis include 
           1.   Fever-due  to bacteremia 
           2.   Murmur-due    to vegetations on heart valve 
           3.   Janeway lesions (erythematous non tender lesions on palms and soles), Osler 
                 nodes (tender lesions on fingers or toes) , and splinter hemorrhages in nail bed-
                 due to embolization of septic vegetations 
           4.   Anemia of chronic disease-due   to chronic inflammation 
     H.   Laboratory findings 
           1.   Positive blood cultures 
           2.   Anemia of chronic disease (,I. Hb, tMCV; t  ferritin,   ,I. TIBC, ,I. serum iron, and 
                 ,I. % saturation) 
           3.   Transesophageal echocardiogram is useful for detecting lesions on valves. 
     I.    Non bacterial thrombotic endocarditis  is due to sterile vegetations that arise in 
           association with a hypercoagulable state or underlying adenocarcinoma. Vegetations 
           arise on the mitral  valve along lines of closure and result in mitral regurgitation. 
     J.   Libman-Sacks endocarditis is due to sterile vegetations that arise in association with 
           SLE. Vegetations are present on the surface and undersurface of the mitral valve and 
           result in  mitral  regurgitation. 



                                                   CARDIOMYOPATHY 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Group of myocardial diseases that result in cardiac dysfunction

             valve. (Courtesy of Aliya Husain, MD)       Jamie Steinmetz, MD) 

90
II.  DILATED   CARDIOMYOPATHY 
     A.   Dilation of all four  chambers of the heart (Fig. 8.18); most common form of 
           cardiomyopathy 
     B.   Results in systolic dysfunction (ventricles cannot pump), leading to biventricular 
           CHF; complications include mitral  and tricuspid valve regurgitation and 
           arrhythmia. 
     C.  Most  commonly idiopathic; other causes include 
           I.    Genetic mutation (usually autosomal dominant) 
           2.   Myocarditis  (usually due to coxsackie A or B)-characterized by a lymphocytic 
                 infiltrate  in the myocardium (Fig. 8.19); results in chest pain, arrhythmia with 
                 sudden death, or heart failure. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a late complication. 
           3.   Alcohol abuse 
           4.   Drugs (e.g., doxorubicin) 
           5.   Pregnancy-seen  during late pregnancy or soon (weeks to months) after 
                 childbirth 
     D.   Treatment is heart transplant. 


III.  HYPERTROPHIC  CARDIOMYOPATHY 
     A.   Massive hypertrophy of the left ventricle 
      B.  Usually due to genetic mutations in sarcomere proteins; most common form is 
           autosomal dominant. 
      C.  Clinical features include 
            I.   Decreased cardiac output-Left  ventricular hypertrophy  leads to diastolic 
                 dysfunction  (ventricle cannot fill). 
           2.   Sudden death due to ventricular arrhythmias; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a 
                 common cause of sudden death in young athletes. 
           3.   Syncope with exercise-Subaortic  hypertrophy of the ventricular septum results 
                 in functional  aortic stenosis. 
      D.  Biopsy shows myofiber hypertrophy with disarray (Fig. 8.20). 


IV. RESTRICTIVE   CARDIOMYOPATHY 
      A.  Decreased compliance of the ventricular endomyocardium that restricts filling 
           during  diastole 
      B.  Causes include amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, endocardial 
           fibroelastosis (children, Fig. 8.21), and Loeffler syndrome (endomyocardial fibrosis 
           with  an eosinophilic infiltrate  and eosinophilia). 
      C.  Presents as congestive heart failure; classic finding is low-voltage EKG with 
           diminished  QRS amplitude.

                                                    CARDIAC     TUMORS 

I.   MYXOMA 
     A.   Benign mesenchymal tumor with a gelatinous appearance and abundant ground

           Klebsiella pneumoniae (Table 9.1) 
     C.  Classic gross phases of lobar pneumonia 
           1.   Congestion- due to congested vessels and edema 
           2.   Red hepatization-due to exudate, neutrophils, and hemorrhage filling the alveolar 
                 air spaces, giving the normally spongy lung a solid consistency (Fig. 9.3B,C) 
           3.   Gray hepatization-due  to degradation of red cells within the exudate 
           4.   Resolution

IV. INTERSTITIAL    (ATYPICAL)   PNEUMONIA 
     A.   Characterized by diffuse interstitial infiltrates (Fig. 9.5) 
     B.   Presents with relatively mild upper respiratory symptoms (minimal sputum and low 
           fever); 'atypical' presentation 
     C.   Caused by bacteria or viruses (Table 9.3) 


V.  ASPIRATION   PNEUMONIA 
     A.   Seen in patients at risk for aspiration (e.g., alcoholics and comatose patients) 
     B.   Most often due to anaerobic bacteria in the oropharynx (e.g., Bacteroides, 
           Fusobacterium, and Peptococcus)

                 nodes that undergoes fibrosis and calcification, forming a Ghon complex (Fig. 
                 9.6A) 
           2.   Primary TB  is generally asymptomatic, but leads to a positive PPD. 
     C.   Secondary TB arises with reactivation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 
           l.    Reactivation is commonly due to AIDS; may also be seen with aging 
           2.   Occurs at apex oflung (high oxygen tension) 
           3.   Forms cavitary foci of caseous necrosis; may also lead to miliary pulmonary TB 
                 or tuberculous bronchopneumonia 
           4.   Clinical  features include fevers and night sweats, cough with hemoptysis, and 
                 weight loss. 
           5.   Biopsy reveals caseating granulomas; AFB stain reveals acid-fast bacilli (Fig. 
                 9.6B,C). 
           6.   Systemic spread often occurs and can involve any tissue; common sites include 
                 meninges (meningitis), cervical lymph nodes, kidneys (sterile pyuria), and 
                 lumbar vertebrae (Pott disease). 



                      CHRONIC    OBSTRUCTIVE      PULMONARY      DISEASE 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
      A.  Group of diseases characterized by airway obstruction; lung does not empty, and air 
           is trapped. 
            l.   Volume of air that can be forcefully expired is decreased (..J.. FVC), especially 
                 during  the first second of expiration (..J....J.. FEY,); results in ..J.. FEV,:FVC ratio 
           2.   Total lung capacity (TLC) is usually increased due to air trapping. 


II.   CHRONIC  BRONCHITIS 
      A.  Chronic productive cough lasting at least 3 months over a minimum of2 years; 
           highly  associated with smoking 
      B.  Characterized by hypertrophy of bronchial mucinous glands (Fig. 9.7) 
            l.   Leads to increased thickness of mucus glands relative to overall bronchial wall 
                 thickness (Reid index increases to > 50%; normal is< 40%).

                                                                1.   Loss of elastic recoil and collapse of airways during exhalation results in 
                                                                      obstruction and air trapping. 
                                                          B.   Due to imbalance of proteases and antiproteases 
                                                                I.    Inflammation  in the lung normally  leads to release of proteases by neutrophils 
                                                                      and macrophages. 
                                                                2.   a,-antitrypsin  (AlAT)   neutralizes proteases. 
                                                                3.   Excessive inflammation or lack of AlAT leads to destruction of the alveolar air 
                                                                      sacs. 
                                                          C.  Smoking is the most common cause of emphysema. 
                                                                I.    Pollutants in smoke lead to excessive inflammation and protease-mediated 
                                                                      damage. 
                                                                2.   Results in centriacinar emphysema that is most severe in the upper lobes 
                                                           D.  AlAT  deficiency is a rare cause of emphysema. 
                                                                1.   Lack of antiprotease leaves the air sacs vulnerable to protease-mediated damage. 
                                                                2.   Results in panacinar emphysema that is most severe in the lower lobes 
                                                                3.   Liver cirrhosis may also be present. 
                                                                      i.    AlAT  deficiency is due to misfolding of the mutated protein. 
                                                                      ii .  Mutant  AlAT  ac cumulates in the endoplasmic re ticulum ofhepatocytes, 
                                                                            resulting in liver  damage. 
                                                                      iii.  Biopsy reveals pink, PAS-positive globules in hepatocytes (Fig. 9.9). 
                                                                4.   Disease severity is based on the degree of AlAT deficiency. 
                                                                      i.    PiM  is the normal allele; two copies are usually expressed (PiMM). 
                                                                      ii.   PiZ  is the most common clinically relevant mutation; results in significantly 
                                                                            low levels of circulating AlAT 
                                                                      iii.   PiMZ heterozygotes are usually asymptomatic with decreased circulating 
                                                                            levels of AlAT; however, significant risk for emphysema with smoking exists. 
                                                                      iv.  PiZZ  homozygotes are at significant risk for panacinar emphysema and 
                                                                            cirrhosis. 
                                                           E.  Clinical  features of emphysema include 
                                                                 1.  Dyspnea and cough with minimal  sputum 
                                                                 2.  Prolonged expiration with  pursed lips ('pink-puffer')

           3.   Weight loss 
           4.   Increased anterior-posterior diameter of chest ('barrel-chest,' Fig. 9.10) 
           5.   Hypoxemia (due to destruction of capillaries in the alveolar sac) and cor 
                 pulmonale are late complications. 


IV. ASTHMA 
     A.   Reversible airway bronchoconstriction, most often due to allergic stimuli (type I 
           hypersensitivity) 
     B.   Presents in childhood; often associated with allergic rhinitis, eczema, and a family 
           history  of atopy 
     C.   Pathogenesis 
           1.   Allergens induce T H2 phenotype in CD4  T cells of genetically susceptible 
                 individuals. 
           2.   T H2 cells secrete IL-4 (mediates class switch to IgE), IL-5 (attracts eosinophils), 
                 and IL -10 (stimulates T H2 cells and inhibits T H1). 
           3.   Reexposure to allergen leads to IgE-mediated activation of mast cells. 
                 i.    Release of preformed histamine granules and generation of leukotrienes C4, 
                       D4, and E4lead to bronchoconstriction, inflammation,  and edema (early-
                       phase reaction). 
                 ii .  Inflammation,  especially major basic protein derived from eosinophils, 
                       damages cells and perpetuates bronchoconstriction (late-phase reaction). 
      D.  Clinical features are episodic and related to allergen exposure. 
            1.  Dyspnea and wheezing 
           2.   Productive cough, classically with spiral-shaped mucus plugs (Curschmann 
                 spirals) and eosinophil-derived crystals (Charcot-Leyden crystals, Fig. 9.11). 
           3.   Severe, unrelenting attack can result in status asthmaticus and death. 
      E.  Asthma may also arise from non allergic causes such as exercise, viral infection, 
           aspirin  (e.g., aspirin intolerant asthma), and occupational exposures. 


V.  BRONCHIECTASIS 
      A.  Permanent dilatation of bronchioles and bronchi (Fig. 9.12); loss of airway tone 
           results in air  trapping. 
      B.  Due to necrotizing inflammation  with  damage to ai rway walls. Causes include 
            1.  Cystic fibrosis 
           2.   Kartagener syndrome-inherited    defect of the dynein arm, which is necessary 
                 for ciliary  movement. Associated with sinusitis, infertility  (poor motility   of 
                 sperm), and situs in versus (position of major organs is reversed, e.g., heart is on 
                 right  side of thorax) 
           3.   Tumor or foreign body 
           4.   Necrotizing  infection

           5.   Allergic  bronchopulmonary aspergillosis-Hypersensitivity     reaction to 
                 Aspergillus leads to chronic inflammatory damage; usually seen in individuals 
                 with  asthma or cystic fibrosis 
     C.   Clinical features 
           l.    Cough, dyspnea, and foul-smelling sputum 
           2.   Complications include hypoxemia with  cor pulmonale and secondary (AA) 
                 amyloidosis. 



                                               RESTRICTIVE     DISEASES 

I.   BASIC  PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Characterized by restricted filling  of the lung; ..J, TLC and ..J, FVC; FEV1:FVC ratio is 
           increased. 
     B.   Most commonly  due to interstitial diseases of the lung; may also arise with chest 
           wall  abnormalities (e.g ., massive obesity) 


II.   IDIOPATHIC   PULMONARY   FIBROSIS 
     A.   Fibrosis of lung interstitium  (Fig. 9.13) 
      B.  Etiology is unknown.  Likely related to cyclical lung injury;             from  injured 
           pneumocytes induces fibrosis. 
            l.   Secondary causes of interstitial fibrosis such as drugs (e.g., bleomycin and 
                 amiodarone) and radiation  therapy must be excluded. 
      C.  Clinical  features 
            l.   Progressive dyspnea and cough 
           2.   Fibrosis on lung CT; initially  seen in subpleural patches, but eventually results in 
                 diffuse fibrosis with  end-stage 'honeycomb' lung 
           3.   Treatment is lung transplantation. 


III.  PNEUMOCONIOSES 
      A.  Interstitial  fibrosis due to occupational exposure; requires chronic exposure to small 
           particles that  are fibrogenic (Table 9.4) 
            l.   Alveolar  macrophages engulf foreign particles and induce fibrosis. 


IV. SARCOIDOSIS 

      A.  Systemic disease characterized by noncaseating granulomas in multiple organs; 
           classically seen in African American  females 
      B.  Etiology is unknown; likely due to CD4 helper T-cell response to an unknown antigen 
      C.  Granulomas most commonly involve the hilar lymph nodes and lung (Fig. 9.15A), 
           leading to restrictive lung disease.

             l.     Characteristic    stellate  inclusions    ('asteroid  bodies')   are often   seen within   giant 

                    cells of  the granulomas    (Fig.  9.15B). 

       D.  Other   commonly    involved   tissues  include   the uvea  (uveitis),  skin   (cutaneous 

             nodules   or erythema   nodosum),    and salivary   and  lacrimal    glands  (mimics   Sjogren 

             syndrome);   almost   any  tissue can  be involved. 

       E.   Clinical   features 

             l.     Dyspnea  or  cough  (most  common    presenting   symptom) 

             2.    Elevated  serum  ACE 

             3.    Hypercalcemia    (l-alpha    hydroxyla    e activity   of  epithelioid   histiocytes    converts 

                    vitamin   D  to  its active  form) 

             4.    Treatment   is steroids;  often   resolves spontaneously    without    treatment. 


V.   HYPERSENSITIVITY          PNEUMONITIS 
      A.    Granulomatous    reaction   to  inhaled   organic  antigens   (e.g., pigeon  breeder's  lung) 
       B.   Presents with   fever,  cough,  and  dyspnea  hours  after  exposure;   resolves with   removal 

             of  the exposure 

       C.  Chronic    exposure  leads  to interstitial     fibrosis.

                                                          B.   Characterized by atherosclerosis of the pulmonary trunk, smooth muscle 
                                                                hypertrophy of pulmonary  arteries, and intimal  fibrosis; plexiform lesions are seen 
                                                                with  severe, long-standing disease (Fig. 9.16). 
                                                          C.   Leads to right ventricular hypertrophy with  eventual cor pulmonale 
                                                          D.   Presents with exertional dyspnea or right-sided heart failure 
                                                          E.   Subclassified as primary or secondary based on etiology 


                                                     II .  PRIMARY  PULMONARY   HYPERTENSION 
                                                          A.   Classically seen in young adult females 
                                                          B.   Etiology is unknown; some familial  forms are related to inactivating mutations of 
                                                                BMPR2, leading to proliferation of vascular smooth muscle. 


                                                     III.  SECONDARY PULMONARY   HYPERTENSION 
                                                           A.  Due to hypoxemia (e.g ., COPD and interstitial lung disease) or increased volume in

                                                     I.    ACUTE RESPIRATORY  DISTRESS SYNDROME 
                                                           A.  Diffuse damage to the alveolar-capillary interface (diffuse alveolar damage) 
                                                           B.  Leakage of protein-rich fluid leads to edema and formation of hyaline membranes in 
                                                                alveoli (Fig. 9.17A). 
                                                           C.  Clinical  features 
                                                                 1.  Hypoxemia and cyanosis with respiratory distress-due  to  thickened diffusion 
                                                                      barrier  and collapse of air sacs (increased surface tension) 
                                                                 2.  'White-out'   on chest x-ray (Fig. 9.17B) 
                                                           D.  Secondary to a variety of disease processes including sepsis, infection, shock, 
                                                                 trauma, aspiration, pancreatitis, DIC, hypersensitivity reactions, and drugs. 
                                                                 1.  Activation  of neutrophils induces protease-mediated and free radical damage of 
                                                                      type I and II  pneumocytes.

II.  NEONATAL   RESPIRATORY  DISTRESS SYNDROME 
     A.   Respiratory distress due to inadequate surfactant levels 
           1.   Surfactant is made by type II pneumocytes; phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) is the 
                 major component. 
           2.   Surfactant decreases surface tension in the lung, preventing collapse of alveolar 
                 air sacs after expiration. 
           3.   Lack of surfactant leads to collapse of air sacs and formation of hyaline 
                 membranes. 
     B.   Associated with 
           1.   Prematurity-Surfactant    production  begins at 28 weeks; adequate levels are not 
                 reached until 34 weeks. 
                 i.    Amniotic  fluid  lecithin to sphingomyelin  ratio is used to screen for lung 
                       maturity. 
                 ii .  Phosphatidylcholine (lecithin)  levels increase as surfactant is produced; 
                       sphingomyelin remains constant. 
                 iii.  A  ratio > 2 indicates adequate surfactant production. 
           2.   Caesarian section delivery-due  to lack of stress-induced steroids; steroids 
                 increase synthesis of surfactant. 
           3.   Maternal diabetes-Insulin    decreases surfactant production. 
     C.   Clinical features 
           1.   Increasing respiratory effort after birth,  tachypnea with use of accessory muscles, 
                 and grunting 
           2.   Hypoxemia with  cyanosis 
           3.   Diffuse granularity  of the lung ('ground-glass' appearance) on x-ray (Fig. 9.18) 
     D.   Complications 
           1.   Hypoxemia increases the risk for persistence of patent ductus arteriosus and 
                 necrotizing enterocolitis. 
           2.   Supplemental oxygen increases the risk for free radical injury. Retinal injury 
                 leads to blindness; lung damage leads to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. 



                                                         LUNG   CANCER 

I.   BASIC  PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Most common cause of cancer mortality in the US; average age at presentation is 60 
           years. 
     B.   Key risk factors are cigarette smoke, radon, and asbestos. 
           1.   Cigarette smoke contains over 60 carcinogens; 85% oflung cancer occurs in 
                 smokers. 
                 i.    Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and arsenic are particularly mutagenic. 
                 ii .  Cancer risk is directly  related to the duration and amount of smoking ('pack-
                       years'). 
           2.   Radon is formed by radioactive decay of uranium, which is present in soil. 
                 i.    Accumulates in closed spaces such as basements 
                 ii.   Responsible for most of the public exposure to ionizing radiation; 2nd most 
                       frequent cause of lung carcinoma in US 
                 iii.  Increased ri sk of lung cancer is also seen in uranium miners. 
     C.   Presenting symptoms are nonspecific (e .g., cough, weight loss, hemoptysis, and 
           postobstructive pneumonia). 
      D.  Imaging often reveals a solitary nodule ('coin-lesion'); biopsy is necessary for a 
           diagnosis of cancer. 
            1.  Benign lesions, which often occur in younger patients, can also produce a 'coin-
                 lesion.' Examples include

                                                                             Midwest) 
                                                                       ii.   Bronchial  hamartoma-benign   tumor  composed of lung tissue and cartilage; 
                                                                             often calcified on imaging 
                                                           E.   Lung carcinoma is classically divided into 2 categories (Table 9.5). 
                                                                  1.  Small cell carcinoma (15%)-usually  not amenable to surgical resection (treated 
                                                                       with  chemotherapy) 
                                                                 2.   Non-small cell carcinoma (85%)-treated upfront with surgical resection (does not

                                                                       ii.   Obstruction  of SVC leads to distended head and neck veins with edema and 
                                                                             blue discoloration of arms and face (superior vena cava syndrome).

I.    PNEUMOTHORAX 
     A.   Accumulation  of air in the pleural space 
      B.  Spontaneous pneumothorax is due to rupture of an emphysematous bleb; seen in 
           young adults 
            l.   Results in collapse of a portion of the lung (Fig. 9.24); trachea shifts to the side of 
                 collapse. 
      C.  Tension pneumothorax arises with penetrating chest wall injury. 
            1.  Air  enters the pleural space, but cannot exit; trachea is pushed opposite to the 
                 side of injury. 
           2.   Medical emergency; treated with insertion of a chest tube 


II.   MESOTHELIOMA 
      A.  Malignant  neoplasm of mesothelial cells; highly associated with occupational 
           exposure to asbestos 
      B.  Presents with recurrent pleural effusions, dyspnea, and chest pain; tumor encases 
           the lung (Fig. 9.25).

                                                   ORAL CAVITY 

I.   CLEFT LIP AND PALATE 
     A. Full-thickness defect of lip or palate (Fig. 10.1) 
     B. Due to failure of facial prominences to fuse 
          l.   During early pregnancy, facial prominences (one from superior, two from the 
               sides, and two from inferior) grow and fuse together to form the face. 
     C. Cleft lip and palate usually occur together; isolated cleft lip or palate is less common. 


II.  APHTHOUS ULCER 
     A.  Painful, superficial ulceration of the oral mucosa (Fig. 10.2) 
     B.  Arises in relation to stress and resolves spontaneously, but often recurs 
     C. Characterized by a grayish base surrounded by erythema 


III. BEH<;ET SYNDROME 
     A.  Recurrent aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, and uveitis 
     B.  Due to immune complex vasculitis involving small vessels 
     C. Can be seen after viral infection, but etiology is unknown 


IV. ORAL HERPES 
     A.  Vesicles involving oral mucosa that rupture, resulting in shallow, painful, red ulcers 
     B.  Usually due to HSV-1 
     C. Primary infection occurs in childhood; lesions heal, but virus remains dormant in 
          ganglia of the trigeminal nerve. 
     D. Stress and sunlight cause reactivation of the virus, leading to vesicles that often arise 
          on the lips (cold sore, Fig. 10.3). 


V.  SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA 
     A.  Malignant neoplasm of squamous cells lining the oral mucosa 
     B.  Tobacco and alcohol are major risk factors . 
     C.  Floor of mouth is the most common location. 
     D.  Oral leukoplakia and erythroplakia are precursor lesions. 
          l.   Leukoplakia is a white plaque that cannot be scraped away; often represents 
               squamous cell dysplasia 
          2.  Leukoplakia is distinct from oral candidiasis (thrush) and hairy leukoplakia. 
               i.   Oral candidiasis is a white deposit on the tongue, which is easily scraped 
                    away (Fig. 10.4); usually seen in immunocompromised states 
               ii.   Hairy leukoplakia is a white, rough ('hairy') patch that arises on the lateral 
                    tongue. It is usually seen in immunocompromised individuals (e .g., AIDS) 
                    and is due to EBV-induced squamous cell hyperplasia; not pre-malignant 
          3.  Erythroplakia (red plaque) represents vascularized leukoplakia and is highly 
               suggestive of squamous cell dysplasia. 
          4.  Erythroplakia and leukoplakia are often biopsied to rule out carcinoma.

                                                          A.   Salivary glands are exocrine glands that secrete saliva. 
                                                          B.   Divided into  major (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands) and minor 
                                                                glands (hundreds of microscopic glands distributed throughout  the oral mucosa)

                                                           B.  Orchitis, pancreatitis, and aseptic meningitis may also be present. 
                                                                 1.  Serum amylase is increased due to salivary gland or pancreatic involvement. 
                                                                2.   Orchitis  carries risk of sterility, especially in teenagers.

                                                           B.  Usually arises in parotid; presents as a mobile, painless, circumscribed mass at the 
                                                                angle of the jaw 
                                                           C.  High  rate of recurrence; extension of small islands of tumor through tumor capsule 
                                                                often leads to incomplete resection (Fig. 10.5). 
                                                           D.  Rarely may transform into carcinoma, which presents with signs of facial nerve

VI. PEPTIC ULCER  DISEASE 
     A.   Solitary mucosal ulcer involving proximal duodenum (90%) or distal stomach (10%) 
     B.   Duodenal ulcer is almost always due to H pylori(> 95%); rarely, may be due to ZE 
           syndrome 
           1.   Presents with epigastric pain that improves with meals 
           2.   Diagnostic endoscopic biopsy shows ulcer with hypertrophy of Brunner glands. 
           3.   May rupture leading to bleeding from the gastroduodenal artery (anterior ulcer) 
                 or acute pancreatitis (posterior ulcer) 
      C.  Gastric ulcer is usually due to H pylori (75%); other causes include NSAIDs and bile 
           reflux. 
            1.  Presents with epigastric pain that worsens with meals 
           2.   Ulcer is usually located on the lesser curvature of the antrum. 
           3.   Rupture carries risk of bleeding from left gastric artery. 
      D.  Differential diagnosis of ulcers includes carcinoma. 
           1.   Duodenal ulcers are almost never malignant (duodenal carcinoma is extremely 
                 rare). 
           2.   Gastric ulcers can be caused by gastric carcinoma (intestinal subtype). 
                 i.    Benign peptic ulcers are usually small(< 3 em), sharply demarcated 
                       ("punched-out"), and surrounded by radiating folds of mucosa (Fig. 10.13A). 
                 ii .  Malignant  ulcers are large and irregular with heaped up margins (Fig. 
                       10.13B) 
                 iii.   Biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis.

      A.  Malignant  proliferation of surface epithelial cells (adenocarcinoma) 
      B.  Subclassified into intestinal and diffuse types 
      C.  Intestinal type (more common) presents as a large, irregular ulcer with heaped up 
            margins; most commonly involves the lesser curvature of the antrum (similar to 
           gastric ulcer) 
            1.  Risk factors include intestinal metaplasia (e.g., due to H pylori and autoimmune 
                 gastritis), nitrosamines in smoked foods (Japan), and blood type A. 
      D.  Diffuse type is characterized by signet ring cells that diffusely infiltrate the gastric 
            wall (Fig. l0.14B) ; desmoplasia results in thickening of stomach wall (linitis plastica, 
            Fig. 10.14A). 

            1.  Not associated with H pylori, intestinal metaplasia, or nitrosamines 
      E.  Gastric carcinoma presents late with weight loss, abdominal pain, anemia, and early 
            satiety; rarely presents as acanthosis nigricans or Leser-Trelat sign 
      F.  Spread to lymph nodes can involve the left supraclavicular node (Virchow node). 
      G.  Distant metastasis most commonly involves liver; other sites include 
            1.  Periumbilical  region (Sister Mary Joseph nodule); seen with intestinal type

                                                                2.   2 inches long and located in the small bowel within 2 feet of the ileocecal valve 
                                                                3.   Can present during the first 2 years of life with bleeding (due to heterotopic 
                                                                      gastric mucosa), volvulus, intussusception, or obstruction (mimics appendicitis); 
                                                                      however, most cases are asymptomatic. 


                                                    III.  VOLVULUS 
                                                          A.  Twisting  of bowel along its mesentery 
                                                          B.   Results in obstruction and disruption of the blood supply with infarction (Fig. 10.17) 
                                                          C.  Most common locations are sigmoid colon (elderly) and cecum (young adults). 


                                                     IV. INTUSSUSCEPTION 
                                                          A.   Telescoping of proximal segment of bowel forward into distal segment 
                                                                1.   Telescoped segment is pulled forward by peristalsis, resulting in obstruction and 
                                                                      disruption of blood supply with infarction. 
                                                          B.   Associated with a leading edge (focus of traction) 
                                                                1.   In children, the most common cause is lymphoid hyperplasia (e.g., due to 
                                                                      rotavirus); usually arises in the terminal ileum, leading to intussusception into 
                                                                      the cecum 
                                                                2.   In adults, the most common cause is tumor. 


                                                     V.  SMALL  BOWEL INFARCTION 
                                                          A.   Small bowel is highly susceptible to ischemic injury.

           1.   Transmural infarction  occurs with thrombosis/embolism of the superior 
                 mesenteric artery or thrombosis of the mesenteric vein. 
           2.   Mucosal infarction occurs with  marked hypotension. 
     B.   Clinical features include abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and decreased bowel 
           sounds. 


VI. LACTOSE INTOLERANCE 
     A.   Decreased function of the lactase enzyme found in the brush border of enterocytes 
           1.   Lactase normally breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose. 
     B.   Presents with abdominal distension and diarrhea upon consumption of milk 
           products; undigested lactose is osmotically active. 
     C.   Deficiency may be congenital (rare autosomal recessive disorder) or acquired (often 
           develops in late childhood); temporary deficiency is seen after small bowel infection 
           (lactase is highly susceptible to injury). 


VII. CELIAC  DISEASE 
     A.   Immune-mediated damage of small bowel villi due to gluten exposure; associated 
           with  HLA-DQ2  and DQS 
     B.   Gluten is present in wheat and grains; its most pathogenic component is gliadin. 
           1.   Once absorbed, gliadin is deamidated by tissue transglutaminase (tTG). 
           2.   Deamidated gliadin is presented by antigen presenting cells via MHC class II. 
           3.   Helper T cells mediate tissue damage. 
      C.  Clinical presentation 
           1.   Children  classically present with abdominal distension, diarrhea, and failure to 
                 thrive. 
           2.   Adults classically present with chronic diarrhea and bloating. 
           3.   Small, herpes-like vesicles may arise on skin (dermatitis herpetiformis). Due to 
                 IgA deposition at the tips of dermal papillae; resolves with gluten-free diet 
      D.  Laboratory findings 
           1.   IgA antibodies against endomysium, tTG, or gliadin; IgG antibodies are also 
                 present and are useful for diagnosis in individuals with IgA deficiency (increased 
                 incidence oflgA  deficiency is seen in celiac disease). 
           2.   Duodenal biopsy reveals flattening of villi, hyperplasia of crypts, and increased 
                 intraepitheliallymphocytes   (Fig. 10.18). Damage is most prominent in the 
                 duodenum; jejunum and ileum are less involved. 
      E.  Symptoms resolve with gluten-free diet. 
           1.   Small bowel carcinoma and T-celllymphoma are late complications that present 
                 as refractory disease despite good dietary control.

                                                                malabsorption 
                                                          B.   Similar to celiac disease except 
                                                                 1.  Occurs in tropical  regions (e.g., Caribbean) 
                                                                2.   Arises after infectious diarrhea and responds to antibiotics 
                                                                3.   Damage is most prominent in jejunum and ileum (secondary vitamin B12 or 
                                                                      folate deficiency may ensue); duodenum is less commonly involved.

                                                           B.  Classic site of involvement is the small bowel lamina propria (Fig. 10.19). 

                                                                 1.  Macrophages compress lacteals. 
                                                                 2.  Chylomicrons cannot be transferred from enterocytes to lymphatics. 
                                                                 3.  Results in fat malabsorption and steatorrhea 
                                                           C.  Other common sites of involvement include synovium of joints (arthritis), cardiac 
                                                                valves, lymph nodes, and CNS. 


                                                     X.  ABETALIPOPROTEINEMIA

                                                           A.  Malignant  proliferation  of neuroendocrine cells; low-grade malignancy 
                                                                 1.  Tumor  cells contain neurosecretory granules that are positive for chromogranin. 
                                                           B.  Can arise anywhere along the gut; small bowel is the most common site. 
                                                                 1.  Grows as a submucosal polyp-like nodule (Fig. 10.20) 
                                                           C.  Often secretes serotonin 
                                                                 1.  Serotonin is released into the portal circulation and metabolized by liver 
                                                                      monoamine oxidase (MAO) into  5-HIAA.

           2.   Carcinoid syndrome is characterized by bronchospasm, diarrhea, and flushing of 
                 skin; symptoms can be triggered by alcohol or emotional stress, which stimulate 
                 serotonin release from the tumor. 
           3.   Carcinoid heart disease is characterized by right-sided valvular fibrosis 
                 (increased collagen) leading to tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary valve 
                stenosis; left-sided valvular lesions are not seen due to presence of monoamine 
                oxidase (metabolizes serotonin) in the lung. 



                                                            APPENDIX 

I.   ACUTE  APPENDICITIS 
     A.   Acute inflammation of the appendix; most common cause of acute abdomen 
     B.   Related to obstruction of the appendix by lymphoid hyperplasia (children) or a 
           fecalith (adults) 
     C.  Clinical  features include 
           l.    Periumbilical pain, fever, and nausea; pain eventually localizes to right lower 
                 quadrant (McBurney point). 
           2.   Rupture results in peritonitis that presents with guarding and rebound 
                 tenderness. 
           3.   Periappendiceal abscess is a common complication. 



                                    INFLAMMATORY       BOWEL    DISEASE 

I.   BASIC  PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Chronic, relapsing inflammation of bowel 
     B.   Possibly due to abnormal immune response to enteric flora 
     C.   Classically presents in young women (teens to 30s) as recurrent bouts of bloody 
           diarrhea and abdominal pain 
           l.    More prevalent in the West, particularly in Caucasians and Eastern European 
                 Jews 
     D.   Diagnosis of exclusion; symptoms mimic other causes of bowel inflammation (e.g., 
           infection). 
     E.   Subclassified as ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease (Table 10.1) 



                                                               COLON 

I.   HIRSCHSPRUNG  DISEASE 
     A.   Defective relaxation and peristalsis of rectum and distal sigmoid colon 
           l.    Associated with Down syndrome 
     B.   Due to congenital failure of ganglion cells (neural crest-derived) to descend into 
           myenteric and submucosal plexus 
           l.    Myenteric (Auerbach) plexus is located between the inner circular and outer 
                 longitudinal  muscle layers of the muscularis propria and regulates motility. 
           2.   Submucosal (Meissner) plexus is located in the submucosa and regulates blood 
                 flow, secretions, and absorption. 
     C.   Clinical features are based on obstruction. 
           l.    Failure to pass meconium 
           2.   Empty rectal vault on digital rectal exam 
           3.   Massive dilatation (megacolon) of bowel proximal to obstruction with risk for 
                 rupture 
     D.   Rectal suction biopsy reveals lack of ganglion cells. 
     E.   Treatment involves resection of the involved bowel; ganglion cells are present in the 
           bowel proximal to the diseased segment.

II.  COLONIC  DIVERTICULA 
     A.   Outpouchings of mucosa and submucosa through the muscularis propria (Fig. 10.23, 
           false diverticulum) 
     B.   Related to wall stress 
           1.   Associated with constipation, straining, and low-fiber diet; commonly seen in 
                 older adults (risk increases with age) 
           2.   Arise where the vasa recta traverse the muscularis propria (weak point in colonic 
                 wall); sigmoid colon is the most common location. 
     C.   Usually asymptomatic; complications include 
           1.   Rectal bleeding (hematochezia) 
           2.   Diverticulitis-due    to obstructing  fecal material; presents with appendicitis-like 
                 symptoms in the left lower quadrant 
           3.   Fistula-Inflamed   diverticulum   ruptures and attaches to a local structure. 
                 Colovesicular fistula presents with air (or stool) in urine. 


III. ANGIODYSPLASIA 
     A.   Acquired malformation  of mucosal and submucosal capillary beds 
      B.  Usually arises in the cecum and right colon due to high wall tension 
      C.  Rupture classically presents as hematochezia in an older adult. 


IV. HEREDITARY   HEMORRHAGIC   TELANGIECTASIA 
      A.  Autosomal dominant disorder resulting in thin-walled  blood vessels, especially in 
           the mouth and GI tract (Fig. 10.24) 
      B.  Rupture presents as bleeding. 


V.  ISCHEMIC   COLITIS 
      A.  Ischemic damage to the colon, usually at the splenic flexure (watershed area of 
           superior mesenteric artery [SMA]) 
      B.  Atherosclerosis of SMA is the most common cause. 
      C.  Presents with postprandial pain and weight loss; infarction results in pain and 
           bloody diarrhea. 


VI. IRRITABLE   BOWEL SYNDROME 
      A.  Relapsing abdominal pain with bloating, flatulence, and change in bowel habits 
           (diarrhea or constipation) that improves with defecation; classically seen in middle-
           aged females 
      B.  Related to disturbed intestinal motility;  no identifiable pathologic changes 
      C.  Increased dietary fiber may improve symptoms.

VII. COLONIC  POLYPS 
     A.   Raised protrusions of colonic mucosa 
     B.   Most common types are hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps. 
           I.    Hyperplastic polyps are due to hyperplasia of glands; classically show a 'serrated' 
                 appearance on microscopy 
                 i.    Most common type of polyp; usually arise in the left colon (rectosigmoid) 
                 ii.   Benign, with no malignant  potential 
           2.   Adenoma to us polyps are due to neoplastic proliferation of glands (Fig. 10.25); 
                 2nd most common type of colonic polyp 
                 i.    Benign, but premalignant; may progress to adenocarcinoma via the 
                       adenoma-carcinoma sequence 
           3.   Adenoma-carcinoma sequence describes the molecular progression from normal 
                 colonic mucosa to adenomatous polyp to carcinoma. 
                 i.    APC (adenomatous polyposis coli gene) mutations (sporadic or germline) 
                       increase risk for formation of polyp. 
                 ii .  K-ras mutation leads to formation of polyp. 
                 iii.   p53 mutation and increased expression of COX allow for progression to 
                       carcinoma; aspirin impedes progression from adenoma to carcinoma. 
      C.  Screening for polyps is performed by colonoscopy and testing for fecal occult blood; 
           polyps are usually clinically silent, but can bleed. 
            1.  Goal is to remove adenomatous polyps before progression to carcinoma. 
      D.  On colonoscopy, hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps look identical. Hence, all 
           polyps are removed and examined microscopically. 
            1.  Greatest risk for progression from adenoma to carcinoma is related to size > 2 
                 em, sessile growth, and villous histology. 


VIII. FAMILIAL    ADENOMATOUS   POLYPOSIS (FAP) 
      A.  Autosomal dominant disorder characterized by lOOs to 1000s of adenoma to us 
            colonic polyps (Fig. 10.26) 
      B.  Due to inherited APC mutation  (chromosome 5); increases propensity to develop 
            adenomatous polyps throughout colon and rectum 
      C.  Colon and rectum are removed prophylactically; otherwise, almost all patients 
            develop carcinoma by 40 years of age. 
      D.  Gardner syndrome is FAP with fibromatosis and osteomas. 
            1.  Fibromatosis is a non-neoplastic proliferation of fibroblasts; arises in 
                 retroperitoneum  (desmoid) and locally destroys tissue 
            2.  Osteoma is a benign tumor of bone that usually arises in the skull. 
      E.  Turcot syndrome is FAP with CNS tumors (medulloblastoma and glial tumors).

IX. JUVENILE  POLYP 
     A.   Sporadic, hamartomatous (benign) polyp that arises in children(< 5 years) 
           l.    Usually presents as a solitary rectal polyp that prolapses and bleeds 
     B.   Juvenile polyposis is characterized by multiple juvenile polyps in the stomach 
           and colon; large numbers of juvenile polyps increase the risk of progression to 
           carcinoma. 


X.  PEUTZ-JEGHERS SYNDROME 
     A.   Hamartomatous (benign) polyps throughout GI  tract and mucocutaneous 
           hyperpigmentation  (freckle-like spots) on lips, oral mucosa, and genital skin; 
           autosomal dominant disorder 
     B.   Increased risk for colorectal, breast, and gynecologic cancer 


XI. COLO RECTAL CARCINOMA 
     A.   Carcinoma arising from colonic or rectal mucosa; 3rd most common site of cancer 
           and 3rd most common cause of cancer-related death 
           l.    Peak incidence is 60-70 years of age. 
     B.   Most commonly arises from adenoma-carcinoma sequence; a second important 
           molecular pathway is microsatellite instability  (MSI). 
           l.    Microsatellites are repeating sequences of noncoding DNA; integrity of sequence 
                 (stability) is maintained during  cell division. 
           2.   Instability  indicates defective DNA copy mechanisms (e.g., DNA mismatch 
                 repair enzymes). 
           3.   Hereditary nonpolyposis colo rectal carcinoma (HNPCC) is due to inherited 
                 mutations in DNA  mismatch repair enzymes. 
                 i.    Increased risk for colorectal, ovarian, and endometrial carcinoma 
                 ii.   Colorectal carcinoma arises de novo (not from adenomatous polyps) at a 
                       relatively early age; usually right-sided 
      C.  Screening for colorectal carcinoma occurs via endoscopy and fecal occult blood 
           testing; begins at 50 years of age 
            l.   Goal is to remove adenomatous polyps before carcinoma develops and to detect 
                 cancer early (before clinical symptoms arise). 
      D.  Carcinoma can develop anywhere along entire length of colon. 
            l.   Left-sided carcinoma usually grows as a 'napkin-ring' lesion; presents with 
                 decreased stool caliber, left lower quadrant pain, and blood-streaked stool 
           2.   Right-sided carcinoma usually grows as a raised lesion; presents with iron-
                 deficiency anemia (occult bleeding) and vague pain. An older adult with iron 
                 deficiency anemia has colorectal carcinoma until proven otherwise. 
      E.  Colonic carcinoma is associated with an increased risk for Streptococcus bovis 
           endocarditis. 
      F.  Staging 
            l.   T -depth   of invasion; tumors limited to the mucosa generally do not spread due 
                 to lack of lymphatics in the mucosa. 
           2.   N-spread   to regional lymph nodes 
           3.   M- distant   spread; most commonly involves the liver 
      G. CEA  is a serum tumor marker that is useful for assessing treatment re sponse and 
           detecting recurrence; not useful for screening

                                      EXOCRINE PANCREAS 

I.  ANNULAR PANCREAS 
    A. Developmental malformation in which the pancreas forms a ring around the 
         duodenum; risk of duodenal obstruction 

II. ACUTE PANCREATITIS 
    A. Inflammation and hemorrhage of the pancreas 
    B. Due to autodigestion of pancreatic parenchyma by pancreatic enzymes 
         1. Premature activation of trypsin leads to activation of other pancreatic enzymes. 
    C. Results in liquefactive hemorrhagic necrosis of the pancreas and fat necrosis of the 
         peripancreatic fat (Fig. 11.1) 
    D. Most commonly due to alcohol and gallstones; other causes include trauma, 
         hypercalcemia, hyperlipidemia, drugs, scorpion stings, mumps, and rupture of a 
         posterior duodenal ulcer. 
    E. Clinical features 
         1. Epigastric abdominal pain that radiates to the back 
         2. Nausea and vomiting 
         3. Periumbilical and flank hemorrhage (necrosis spreads into the periumbilical soft 
             tissue and retroperitoneum) 
         4. Elevated serum lipase and amylase; lipase is more specific for pancreatic damage. 
         5. Hypocalcemia (calcium is consumed during saponification in fat necrosis) 
    F.  Complications 
         1. Shock-due to peri pancreatic hemorrhage and fluid sequestration 
         2. Pancreatic pseudocyst-formed by fibrous tissue surrounding liquefactive 
             necrosis and pancreatic enzymes 
             i.   Presents as an abdominal mass with persistently elevated serum amylase 
             ii.  Rupture is associated with release of enzymes into the abdominal cavity and 
                  hemorrhage. 
         3. Pancreatic abscess-often due toE coli; presents with abdominal pain, high fever, 
             and persistently elevated amylase 
         4. DIC and ARDS 

III. CHRONIC PANCREATITIS 
    A. Fibrosis of pancreatic parenchyma, most often secondary to recurrent acute 
         pancreatitis 
         1. Most commonly due to alcohol (adults) and cystic fibrosis (children); however, 
             many cases are idiopathic. 
    B. Clinical features 
         1. Epigastric abdominal pain that radiates to the back 
         2. Pancreatic insufficiency-results in malabsorption with steatorrhea and fat-
             soluble vitamin deficiencies. Amylase and lipase are not useful serologic markers 
             of chronic pancreatitis. 
         3. Dystrophic calcification of pancreatic parenchyma on imaging; contrast studies 
             reveal a 'chain oflakes' pattern due to dilatation of pancreatic ducts.

                                                                5.   Increased risk for pancreatic carcinoma 


                                                     IV. PANCREATIC  CARCINOMA 
                                                          A.   Adenocarcinoma arising from the pancreatic ducts 
                                                                l.    Most commonly  seen in the elderly (average age is 70 years) 
                                                          B.   Major risk factors are smoking and chronic pancreatitis. 
                                                          C.   Clinical features (usually occur late in disease) 
                                                                l.    Epigastric abdominal pain and weight loss 
                                                                2.   Obstructive jaundice with  pale stools and palpable gallbladder; associated with

     D.  Bilirubin  stones (pigmented) are composed of bilirubin (Fig. 11.2B). 

           1.   Usually radiopaque 
           2.   Risk factors include extravascular hemolysis (increased bilirubin in bile) and 
                 biliary tract infection  (e.g., E coli, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Clonorchis sinensis). 
                 i.   Ascaris lumbricoides is a common roundworm  that infects 25% of the 
                      world's  population, especially in areas with poor sanitation  (fecal-oral 
                       transmission); infects the biliary  tract, increasing the risk  for gallstones 
                 ii.   Clonorchis sinensis is endemic in China, Korea, and Vietnam (Chinese 
                      liver  fluke); infects the biliary  tract, increasing the risk  for gallstones, 
                      cholangitis,  and cholangiocarcinoma 
     E.   Gallstones are usually asymptomatic; complications include biliary  colic, acute 
           and chronic cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, gallstone ileus, and gallbladder 
           cancer. 


III. BILIARY   COLIC 
     A.   Waxing and waning right upper quadrant pain 
     B.   Due to the gallbladder contracting against a stone lodged in the cystic duct 
     C.  Symptoms are relieved if the stone passes. 
     D.  Common  bile duct obstruction may result in acute pancreatitis or obstructive 
           jaundice. 


IV. ACUTE  CHOLECYSTITIS 
     A.   Acute inflammation of the gallbladder wall 
     B.   Impacted stone in the cystic duct results in dilatation with pressure ischemia, 
           bacterial overgrowth (E coli), and inflammation. 
     C.   Presents with right upper quadrant pain, often radiating to right scapula, fever with 
           i  WBC  count, nausea, vomiting, and i serum alkaline phosphatase (from duct 
           damage) 
     D.   Risk of rupture if left untreated 


V.  CHRONIC  CHOLECYSTITIS 
     A.   Chronic inflammation  of the gallbladder 
     B.   Due to chemical irritation  from longstanding cholelithiasis, with or without 
           superimposed bouts of acute cholecystitis 
     C.   Characterized by herniation of gallbladder mucosa into the muscular wall 
           (Rokitansky-Aschotf sinus, Fig. 11.3A) 

     D.   Presents with vague right upper quadrant pain, especially after eating 
     E.   Porcelain gallbladder is a late complication (Fig. 11.3B). 
           1.   Shrunken, hard gallbladder due to chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and 
                 dystrophic calcification

                                                           B.  Usually due to ascending infection with enteric gram-negative bacteria 
                                                           C.  Presents as sepsis (high fever and chills), jaundice, and abdominal pain 
                                                           D.  Increased incidence with choledocholithiasis (stone in biliary ducts) 


                                                     VII. GALLSTONE   ILEUS 
                                                           A.  Gallstone enters and obstructs the small bowel 
                                                           B.  Due to cholecystitis with  fistula formation  between the gallbladder and small bowel

                                                                 wall (Fig. 11.4) 
                                                           B.  Gallstones are a major risk factor, especially when complicated by porcelain 
                                                                 gallbladder. 
                                                           C.  Classically presents as cholecystitis in an elderly woman 
                                                           D.  Poor prognosis

                                                           A.  Yellow discoloration ofthe  skin  (Fig. ll.5);  earliest sign is scleral icterus (yellow 
                                                                 discoloration of the sclera). 
                                                           B.  Due tot    serum bilirubin,  usually > 2.5 mg/dL 
                                                           C.  Arises with  disturbances in bilirubin  metabolism (Table 11.1 ) 
                                                           D.  Normal  bilirubin  metabolism 
                                                                 1.   RBCs are consumed by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system. 
                                                                 2.   Protoporphyrin  (from heme) is converted to unconjugated bilirubin  (UCB). 
                                                                 3.   Albumin  carries UCB to the liver. 
                                                                 4.   Uridine glucuronyl  transferase (UGT) in hepatocytes conjugates bilirubin.

                                                                       stored in the gallbladder. 
                                                                 6.   Bile is released into the small bowel to aid in digestion. 
                                                                 7.   Intestinal flora convert CB to urobilinogen,  which makes the stool brown. 
                                                                       Urobilinogen  is also partially reabsorbed into the blood and filtered by the

                                                  CONGENITAL 

I.   HORSESHOE KIDNEY 
     A. Conjoined kidneys usually connected at the lower pole (Fig. 12.1); most common 
          congenital renal anomaly 
     B. Kidney is abnormally located in the lower abdomen; horseshoe kidney gets caught 
          on the inferior mesenteric artery root during its ascent from the pelvis to the 
          abdomen. 


II.  RENAL AGENESIS 
     A. Absent kidney formation; may be unilateral or bilateral 
     B. Unilateral agenesis leads to hypertrophy of the existing kidney; hyperfiltration 
          increases risk of renal failure later in life. 
     C. Bilateral agenesis leads to oligohydramnios with lung hypoplasia, flat face with low 
          set ears, and developmental defects of the extremities (Potter sequence, Fig. 12.2); 
          incompatible with life 


III. DYSPLASTIC KIDNEY 
     A.  Noninherited, congenital malformation of the renal parenchyma characterized by 
          cysts and abnormal tissue (e.g., cartilage, Fig. 12.3) 
     B.  Usually unilateral; when bilateral, must be distinguished from inherited polycystic 
          kidney disease 


IV. POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE (PKD) 
     A.  Inherited defect leading to bilateral enlarged kidneys with cysts in the renal cortex 
          and medulla (Fig. 12.4) 
     B.  Autosomal recessive form presents in infants as worsening renal failure and 
          hypertension; newborns may present with Potter sequence. 
          1.  Associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis (leads to portal hypertension) and 
               hepatic cysts 
     C. Autosomal dominant form presents in young adults as hypertension (due to 
          increased renin), hematuria, and worsening renal failure. 
          1.  Due to mutation in the APKDl or APKD2 gene; cysts develop over time. 
          2.  Associated with berry aneurysm, hepatic cysts, and mitral valve prolapse 


V.  MEDULLARY CYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE 
     A.  Inherited (autosomal dominant) defect leading to cysts in the medullary collecting 
          ducts 
     B.  Parenchymal fibrosis results in shrunken kidneys and worsening renal failure. 


                                    ACUTE  RENAL FAILURE (ARF) 

I.   BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A.  Acute, severe decrease in renal function (develops within days) 
     B.  Hallmark is azotemia (increased BUN and creatinine [Cr]), often with oliguria.

                                                    II.   PRERENAL AZOTEMIA 
                                                          A.  Due to decreased blood flow to kidneys (e.g. , cardiac failure) ; common cause of ARF 
                                                          B.  Decreased blood flow results in -!.- GFR, azotemia, and oliguria. 
                                                          C.  Reabsorption of fluid and BUN ensues (serum BUN:Cr ratio > 15); tubular function 
                                                               remains intact (fractional excretion of sodium [FEN a] < 1% and urine osmolality 
                                                                [osm] > 500 mOsm/kg). 


                                                    III.  POSTRENAL AZOTEMIA 
                                                          A.  Due to obstruction of urinary  tract downstream from the kidney (e .g. , ureters) 
                                                          B.  Decreased outflow results in-!.- GFR, azotemia, and oliguria.

     B.  Characterized by crescents in Bowman space (of glomeruli) on H&E stain; crescents 
           are comprised of fibrin and macrophages (Fig. 12.14). 
     C.  Clinical  picture and IF help resolve etiology (Table 12.1). 


IV. IgA NEPHROPATHY   (BERGER DISEASE) 
     A.  IgA  immune complex deposition in mesangium of glomeruli; most common 
           nephropathy worldwide 
     B.   Presents during childhood as episodic gross or microscopic hematuria with RBC 
           casts, usually following mucosal infections (e.g., gastroenteritis) 
           1.   IgA production is increased during infection. 
     C.  IgA  immune complex deposition in the mesangium is seen on IF (Fig. 12.16}. 
     D.  May slowly progress to renal failure 


V.  ALPORT  SYNDROME 
     A.   Inherited defect in type IV collagen; most commonly X-linked 
     B.   Results in thinning and splitting of the glomerular basement membrane 
     C.  Presents as isolated hematuria, sensory hearing loss, and ocular disturbances 



                                          URINARY    TRACT   INFECTION 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Infection of urethra, bladder, or kidney 
     B.   Most commonly arises due to ascending infection; increased incidence in females 
     C.   Risk factors include sexual intercourse, urinary stasis, and catheters. 


II.   CYSTITIS 
     A.   Infection of the bladder 
      B.  Presents as dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency, and suprapubic pain; systemic signs 
           (e.g., fever) are usually absent. 
      C.  Laboratory findings 

           1.   Urinalysis-cloudy   urine  with>  10 WBCs/high power field (hpf) 
           2.   Dipstick-Positive   leukocyte esterase (due to pyuria) and nitrites (bacteria 
                 convert nitrates to nitrites) 
           3.   Culture-greater   than 100,000 colony forming units (gold standard) 
      D.  Etiology 
            1.  E coli (80%) 
           2.   Staphylococcus saprophyticus-increased incidence in young, sexually active 
                 women (but E coli is still more common in this population) 
           3.   Klebsiella pneumoniae 
           4.   Proteus mirabilis-alkaline   urine with  ammonia scent

           5.  Enterococcus faecalis 
     E.  Sterile pyuria is the presence of pyuria(> 10 WBCs/hpf and leukocyte esterase) with 
           a negative urine culture. 
           1.   Suggests urethritis due to Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae 
                 (dominant presenting sign of urethritis is dysuria) 


III. PYELONEPHRITIS 
     A.   Infection of the kidney 
           1.   Usually due to ascending infection; increased risk with vesicoureteral reflux 
     B.   Presents with fever, flank pain, WBC casts, and leukocytosis in addition to 
           symptoms of cystitis 
     C.   Most common pathogens are 
           1.   E coli (90%) 
           2.   Klebsiella species 
           3.   Enterococcus faecalis 


IV. CHRONIC  PYELONEPHRITIS 
      A.  Interstitial  fibrosis and atrophy of tubules due to multiple bouts of acute 
           pyelonephritis 
      B.  Due to vesicoureteral reflux (children) or obstruction (e.g., BPH or cervical 
           carcinoma) 
      C.  Leads to cortical scarring with blunted calyces; scarring at upper and lower poles is 
           characteristic of vesicoureteral reflux. 
      D.  Atrophic tubules containing eosinophilic proteinaceous material resemble thyroid 
           follicles ('thyroidization'  of the kidney, Fig. 12.17); waxy casts may be seen in urine. 



                                                    NEPHROLITHIASIS 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
      A.  Precipitation of a urinary solute as a stone (Table 12.2) 
      B.  Risk factors include high concentration of solute in the urinary filtrate and low urine 
           volume. 
      C.  Presents as colicky pain with hematuria and unilateral flank tenderness 
            1.  Stone is usually passed within hours; if not, surgical intervention may be 
                 required. 



                                            CHRONIC    RENAL   FAILURE 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
      A.  End-stage kidney failure 
            1.  May result from glomerular, tubular, inflammatory, or vascular insults 
           2.   Most common causes are diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and glomerular 
                 disease. 
      B.  Clinical  Features 
            1.  Uremia-Increased  nitrogenous waste products in blood (azotemia) result 
                 in nausea, anorexia, pericarditis, platelet dysfunction, encephalopathy with 
                 asterixis, and deposition of urea crystals in skin. 
            2.  Salt and water retention with resultant hypertension 
            3.  Hyperkalemia with  metabolic acidosis 
           4.   Anemia due to decreased erythropoietin production by renal peritubular 
                 interstitial  cells 

140
            5.    Hypocalcemia    due to  decreased !-alpha-hydroxylation       of vitamin    D  by proximal 

                   renal  tubule  cells  and  hyperphosphatemia 
            6.    Renal  osteodystrophy   due  to secondary   hyperparathyroidism,      osteomalacia,  and 

                   osteoporosis 
      C.   Treatment   involves  dialysis  or  renal  transplant. 

             l.    Cysts  often  develop  within   shrunken   end-stage  kidneys   during   dialysis, 

                   increasing   risk  for  renal cell  carcinoma. 



                                                          RENAL     NEOPLASIA

                                                                      ACTH)  may also be present. 
                                                                3.   Rarely may present with left-sided varicocele 
                                                                      i.    Involvement of the left renal vein by carcinoma blocks drainage of the left

                                                          D.   Pathogenesis involves loss of VHL (3p) tumor suppressor gene, which leads 
                                                                to increased IGF-1 (promotes growth) and increased HIF transcription factor 
                                                                (increases VEGF and PDGF). 
                                                           E.  Tumors may be hereditary or sporadic. 
                                                                 1.  Sporadic tumors classically arise in adult males (average age is 60 years) as a 
                                                                      single tumor in  the upper pole of the kidney; major risk factor for sporadic

                                                           B.  Presents as a large, unilateral flank mass with hematuria and hypertension (due to 
                                                                 renin secretion) 
                                                           C.  Associated with WTI  mutation, especially in syndromic cases 
                                                                 1.  WAGR syndrome-Wilms    tumor, Aniridia,   Genital abnormalities, and mental

                                LOWER   URINARY   TRACT   CARCINOMA 

I.   UROTHELIAL    (TRANSITIONAL   CELL)  CARCINOMA 
     A.   Malignant tumor arising from  the urotheliallining   of the renal pelvis, ureter, 
           bladder, or urethra 
           1.   Most common type of lower urinary tract cancer; usually arises in the bladder 
     B.   Major risk factor is cigarette smoke; additional risk factors are naphthylamine, azo 
           dyes, and long-term cyclophosphamide or phenacetin use. 
     C.  Generally seen in older adults; classically presents with painless hematuria 
     D.  Arises via two distinct pathways (Fig. 12.21) 
           1.   Flat-develops  as a high-grade flat tumor and then invades; associated with early 
                 p53 mutations 
           2.   Papillary-develops  as a low-grade papillary tumor that progresses to a high-
                 grade papillary tumor and then invades; not associated with early p53 mutations 
     E.   Tumors are often multifocal and recur ("field defect"). 


II.  SQUAMOUS  CELL CARCINOMA 
     A.   Malignant proliferation  of squamous cells, usually involving the bladder 
     B.   Arises in a background of squamous metaplasia (normal bladder surface is not lined 
           by squamous epithelium) 
     C.   Risk factors include chronic cystitis (older woman), Schistosoma hematobium 
           infection  (Egyptian male), and long-standing nephrolithiasis. 


III.  ADENOCARCINOMA 
     A.   Malignant proliferation  of glands, usually involving bladder 
     B.   Arises from a urachal remnant (tumor develops at the dome of the bladder), cystitis 
           glandularis, or exstrophy (congenital failure to form the caudal portion of the 
           anterior abdominal and bladder walls)

                                                        VULVA 

I.   BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A. Anatomically includes the skin and mucosa of the female genitalia external to the 
          hymen (labia majora, labia minora, mons pubis, and vestibule) 
     B. Lined by squamous epithelium 


II.  BARTHOLIN CYST 
     A. Cystic dilation of the Bartholin gland 
          1.  One Bartholin gland is present on each side of the vaginal canal and produces 
               mucus-like fluid that drains via ducts into the lower vestibule. 
     B. Arises due to inflammation and obstruction of gland 
          1.  Usually occurs in women of reproductive age 
     C. Presents as a unilateral, painful cystic lesion at the lower vestibule adjacent to the 
          vaginal canal 


III. CONDYLOMA 
     A.  Warty neoplasm of vulvar skin, often large 
     B. Most commonly due to HPV types 6 or 11 (condyloma acuminatum, Fig. 13.1A); 
          secondary syphilis (condyloma latum) is a less common cause. Both are sexually 
          transmitted. 
     C. Histologically, HPV-associated condylomas are characterized by koilocytes 
          (hallmark ofHPV-infected cells, Fig. l3.1B). 
     D. Condylomas rarely progress to carcinoma (6 and 11 are low-risk HPV types). 


IV. LICHEN SCLEROSIS 
     A.  Characterized by thinning of the epidermis and fibrosis (sclerosis) of the dermis 
     B.  Presents as a white patch (leukoplakia) with parchment-like vulvar skin 
     C. Most commonly seen in postmenopausal women; possible autoimmune etiology 
     D. Benign, but associated with a slightly increased risk for squamous cell carcinoma 


V.  LICHEN SIMPLEX CHRONICUS 
     A.  Characterized by hyperplasia of the vulvar squamous epithelium 
     B.  Presents as leukoplakia with thick, leathery vulvar skin 
     C. Associated with chronic irritation and scratching 
     D. Benign; no increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma 


VI. VULVAR CARCINOMA 
     A.  Carcinoma arising from squamous epithelium lining the vulva 
     B.  Relatively rare, accounting for only a small percentage of female genital cancers 
     C.  Presents as leukoplakia; biopsy may be required to distinguish carcinoma from other 
          causes ofleukoplakia. 
     D.  Etiology may be HPV related or non-HPV related. 
     E.  HPV-related vulvar carcinoma is due to high-risk HPV types 16 and 18. 

145
           1.   Risk factors are related to HPV exposure and include multiple partners and early 
                 first age of intercourse; generally occurs in women of reproductive age 
           2.   Arises from vulvar intraepithelial  neoplasia (VIN), a dysplastic precursor lesion 
                 characterized by koilocytic change, disordered cellular maturation, nuclear 
                 atypia, and increased mitotic activity 
     F.   Non-HPV  related vulvar carcinoma arises, most often, from long-standing lichen 
           sclerosis. 
           1.   Chronic inflammation  and irritation  eventually lead to carcinoma. 
           2.   Generally seen in elderly women (average age is > 70 years) 


VII. EXTRAMAMMARY     PAGET DISEASE 
     A.   Characterized by malignant epithelial cells in the epidermis of the vulva (Fig. 13.2) 
     B.   Presents as erythematous, pruritic, ulcerated vulvar skin 
     C.   Represents carcinoma in situ, usually with no underlying carcinoma 
           1.   Paget disease of the nipple is also characterized by malignant epithelial cells in 
                 the epidermis of the nipple, but it is almost always associated with an underlying 
                 carcinoma. 
     D.   Must be distinguished from melanoma, which rarely can occur on the vulva 
           1.   Paget cells are PAS+, keratin+, and SlOO-. 
           2.   Melanoma is PAS-, keratin-, and SlOO+. 



                                                               VAGINA 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
      A.  Canal leading to the cervix 
      B.  Mucosa is lined by non-keratinizing squamous epithelium 


II.   ADENOSIS 
      A.  Focal persistence of columnar epithelium in the upper 1/3 of the vagina 
            1.  During  development, squamous epithelium from the lower 2/3 of the vagina 
                 (derived from the urogenital sinus) grows upward to replace the columnar 
                 epithelium  lining of the upper 1/3 of the vagina (derived from the Mullerian 
                 ducts). 
      B.  Increased incidence in females who were exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero 


III.  CLEAR CELL  ADENOCARCINOMA 
      A.  Malignant  proliferation  of glands with clear cytoplasm 
      B.  Rare, but feared, complication of DES-associated vaginal adenosis 



















             Fig. 13.1 Condyloma acuminata. A, Microscopic appearance. 8, Koilocytic change. 

146
     C.  Discovery of this complication (along with other DES-induced abnormalities of 
           the gynecologic tract such as abnormal shape of the uterus) led to cessation of DES 
           usage. 


IV. EMBRYONAL  RHABDOMYOSARCOMA 
     A.  Malignant  mesenchymal proliferation of immature skeletal muscle; rare 
     B.   Presents as bleeding and a grape-like mass protruding from the vagina or penis of a 
           child (usually<  5 yrs of age); also known as sarcoma botryoides (Fig. 13.3) 
     C.  Rhabdomyoblast, the characteristic cell, exhibits cytoplasmic cross-striations and 
           positive immunohistochemical staining for desmin and myogen in. 


V.  VAGINAL  CARCINOMA 
     A.   Carcinoma arising from squamous epithelium lining the vaginal mucosa 
     B.   Usually related to high-risk HPV 
     C.  Precursor lesion is vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN). 
     D.  When spread to regional lymph nodes occurs, cancer from the lower 2/3 of vagina 
           goes to inguinal nodes, and cancer from the upper 1/3 goes to regional iliac nodes. 



                                                               CERVIX 

I.   BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Anatomically, comprises the "neck" of the uterus 
     B.   Divided into the exocervix (visible on vaginal exam) and endocervix 
           1.   Exocervix is lined by non keratinizing squamous epithelium. 
           2.   Endocervix is lined by a single layer of columnar cells. 
           3.   Junction between the exocervix and endocervix is called the transformation 
                 zone (Fig. 13.4A). 


II.  HPV 
     A.   Sexually transmitted DNA virus that infects the lower genital tract, especially the 
           cervix in the transformation zone 
     B.   Infection is usually eradicated by acute inflammation; persistent infection leads to 
           an increased risk for cervical dysplasia (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, CIN). 
     C.  Risk of CIN depends on HPV type, which is determined by DNA sequencing. 
           1.   High-risk-HPV    types 16, 18, 31, and 33 
           2.   Low-risk-HPV   types 6 and 11 
     D.   High-risk HPV produce E6 and E7 proteins which result in increased destruction of 
           p53 and Rb, respectively. Loss of these tumor suppressor proteins increases the risk 
           for CIN.

                                                    III.  CERVICAL  INTRAEPITHELIAL      NEOPLASIA 
                                                          A.  Characterized by koilocytic  change, disordered cellular maturation, nuclear atypia, 
                                                                and increased mitotic activity within  the cervical epithelium. 
                                                          B.   Divided into grades based on the extent of epithelial involvement by immature 
                                                                dysplastic cells 
                                                                1.   CIN I involves < 1/3 of the thickness of the epithelium. 
                                                                2.   CIN II  involves < 2/3 of the thickness of the epithelium. 
                                                                3.   ClN lll   involves slightly less than the entire thickness of the epithelium (Fig. 
                                                                      13.4B). 
                                                                4.   Carcinoma in situ (CIS) involves the entire thickness ofthe epithelium. 
                                                          C.  CIN  classically progresses in a stepwise fashion through CIN I, CIN II, CIN III, and 
                                                                CIS to become invasive squamous cell carcinoma. 
                                                                I.    Progression is not inevitable (e.g., CIN I often regresses). 
                                                                2.   The higher the grade of dysplasia, the more likely it is to progress to carcinoma 
                                                                      and the less likely it is to regress to normal. 


                                                     IV. CERVICAL  CARCINOMA 
                                                          A.   Invasive carcinoma that arises from the cervical epithelium 
                                                           B.  Most commonly seen in middle-aged women (average age is 40- 50 years) 
                                                          C.   Presents as vaginal bleeding, especially postcoital bleeding, or cervical discharge 
                                                           D.  Key risk factor is high-risk HPV infection;  secondary risk factors include smoking 
                                                                and immunodeficiency  (e.g ., cervical carcinoma is an AIDS-defining illness). 
                                                           E.  Most common subtypes of cervical carcinoma are squamous cell carcinoma (SO% of 
                                                                cases) and adenocarcinoma (15% of cases). Both types are related to HPV infection. 
                                                           F.  Advanced tumors often invade through the anterior uterine wall into  the bladder, 
                                                                blocking  the ureters. Hydronephrosis with postrenal failure is a common cause of 
                                                                death in advanced cervical carcinoma. 


                                                     V.  SCREENING  AND  PREVENTION   OF CERVICAL  CARCINOMA 
                                                           A.  The goal of screening is to catch dysplasia (CIN) before it develops into carcinoma. 
                                                                 1.  Progression from CIN to carcinoma, on average, takes 10-20 years. 
                                                                2.   Screening begins at age 21 and is initially performed yearly. 
                                                           B.  Pap smear is the gold standard for screening. 
                                                                 1.  Cells are scraped from the transformation zone using a brush and analyzed 
                                                                      under a microscope. 
                                                                 2.  Dysplastic cells are classified as low grade (CIN I) or high grade (CIN II and Ill). 
                                                                 3.  High-grade dysplasia is characterized by cells with hyperchromatic (dark) nuclei 
                                                                      and high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios (Fig. 13.4C). 
                                                           C.  Pap smear is the most successful screening test developed to date.

           1.  It  is responsible for a significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality of 
                cervical carcinoma (cervical carcinoma went from being the most common to 
                one of the least common types of gynecologic carcinoma in the US). 
           2.  Women who develop invasive cervical carcinoma usually have not undergone 
                screening. 
     D.  An abnormal Pap smear is followed by confirmatory colposcopy (visualization of 
           cervix with a magnifying  glass) and biopsy. 
     E.   Limitations of the Pap smear include inadequate sampling of the transformation 
           zone (false negative screening) and limited efficacy in screening for adenocarcinoma. 
           1.   Despite Pap smear screening, the incidence of adenocarcinoma has not 
                 decreased significantly. 
     F.   Immunization  is effective in preventing HPV infections. 

           1.   The quadrivalent vaccine covers HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. 
           2.   Antibodies generated against types 6 and ll protect against condylomas. 
           3.   Antibodies generated against types 16 and 18 protect against CIN and 
                 carcinoma. 
           4.   Protection lasts for 5 years. 
           5.   Pap smears are still necessary due to the limited number of HPV types covered 
                 by the vaccine. 



                                 ENDOMETRIUM       AND   MYOMETRIUM 

I.   BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Endometrium is the mucosal lining of the uterine cavity. 
     B.   Myometrium  is the smooth muscle wall underlying the endometrium (Fig. 13.5). 
     C.  Endometrium  is hormonally sensitive. 
           1.   Growth of the endometrium is estrogen driven (proliferative phase). 
           2.   Preparation of the endometrium for implantation is progesterone driven 
                 (secretory phase). 
           3.   Shedding occurs with loss of progesterone support (menstrual phase). 


II.  ASHERMAN   SYNDROME 
     A.   Secondary amenorrhea due to loss of the basalis and scarring 
     B.   Result of overaggressive dilation and curettage (D&C) 


III. ANOVULATORY    CYCLE 
     A.   Lack of ovulation 
     B.   Results in an estrogen-driven proliferative phase without a subsequent progesterone-
           driven secretory phase 
           1.   Proliferative glands break down and shed resulting in uterine bleeding.

                                                                2.   Represents a common cause of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, especially during 
                                                                      menarche and menopause 


                                                     IV. ACUTE  ENDOMETRITIS 
                                                          A.   Bacterial infection of the endometrium 
                                                          B.   Usually due to retained products of conception (e.g., after delivery or miscarriage); 
                                                                retained products act as a nidus for infection. 
                                                          C.   Presents as fever, abnormal uterine bleeding, and pelvic pain 


                                                     V.  CHRONIC   ENDOMETRITIS 
                                                           A.  Chronic inflammation  of the endometrium 
                                                           B.  Characterized by lymphocytes and plasma cells 
                                                                 1.  Plasma cells are necessary for the diagnosis of chronic endometritis given that 
                                                                      lymphocytes are normally found  in the endometrium. 
                                                           C.  Causes include retained products of conception, chronic pelvic inflammatory 
                                                                disease (e .g., Chlamydia), IUD, and TB. 
                                                           D.  Presents as abnormal uterine bleeding, pain, and infertility 


                                                     VI. ENDOMETRIAL    POLYP 
                                                           A.  Hyperplastic protrusion  of endometrium  (Fig. 13.6) 
                                                           B.  Presents as abnormal uterine bleeding 
                                                           C.  Can arise as a side effect of tamoxifen, which has anti-estrogenic effects on the breast 
                                                                 but weak pro-estrogenic effects on the endometrium 


                                                     VII.  ENDOMETRIOSIS 
                                                           A.  Endometrial  glands and stroma outside ofthe uterine endometrial lining 
                                                                 l.    Most likely due to retrograde menstruation with  implantation at an ectopic site 
                                                           B.  Presents as dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation) and pelvic pain; may cause 
                                                                 infertility 
                                                                 l.    Endometriosis cycles just like normal endometrium. 
                                                           C.  Most common site of involvement is the ovary, which classically results in formation 
                                                                 of a 'chocolate' cyst (Fig. l3.7A). 
                                                                 l.    Other sites of involvement include the uterine ligaments (pelvic pain), pouch of 
                                                                       Douglas (pain with defecation), bladder wall (pain with urination),  bowel serosa 
                                                                       (abdominal pain and adhesions), and fallopian tube mucosa (scarring increases 
                                                                       risk for ectopic tubal pregnancy); implants classically appear as yellow-brown 
                                                                       'gun-powder' nodules (Fig. l3.7B). 
                                                                 2.   Involvement of the uterine myometrium is called adenomyosis. 
                                                           D.  There is an increased risk of carcinoma at the site of endometriosis, especially in the 
                                                                 ovary.

VIII .ENDOMETRIAL   HYPERPLASIA 
     A.   Hyperplasia of endometrial glands relative to stroma (Fig. 13.8) 
     B.   Occurs as a consequence of unopposed estrogen (e.g., obesity, polycystic ovary 
           syndrome, and estrogen replacement) 
     C.  Classically presents as postmenopausal uterine bleeding 
     D.   Classified histologically based on architectural growth pattern (simple or complex) 
           and the presence or absence of cellular atypia 
           l.    Most important  predictor for progression to carcinoma (major complication) is 
                 the presence of cellular atypia; simple hyperplasia with atypia often progresses to 
                 cancer (30 %); whereas, complex hyperplasia without atypia rarely does (<5%). 


IX. ENDOMETRIAL    CARCINOMA 
      A.  Malignant proliferation  of endometrial glands (Fig. 13.9A) 
            l.   Most common invasive carcinoma of the female genital tract 
      B.  Presents as postmenopausal bleeding 
      C.  Arises via two distinct pathways: hyperplasia and sporadic 
      D.  In the hyperplasia pathway (75% of cases), carcinoma arises from endometrial 
           hyperplasia. 
            l.   Risk factors are related to estrogen exposure and include early menarche/late 
                 menopause, nulliparity, infertility  with  anovulatory cycles, and obesity. 
           2.   Average age of presentation is 60 years. 
           3.   Histology is endometrioid (i.e ., normal endometrium-like, Fig . 13.9B) . 
      E.  In the sporadic pathway (25% of cases), carcinoma arises in an atrophic 
           endometrium  with no evident precursor lesion. 
            l.   Average age at presentation is 70 years. 
           2.   Histology is usually serous and is characterized by papillary structures (Fig. 
                 13.9C) with psammoma body formation; p53 mutation is common, and the 
                 tumor  exhibits aggressive behavior. 


X.  LEIOMYOMA   (FIBROIDS) 
      A.  Benign neoplastic proliferation of smooth muscle arising from myometrium; most 
            common tumor in females 
      B.  Related to estrogen exposure 
            l.   Common  in premenopausal women 
            2.  Often multiple 
            3.  Enlarge during pregnancy; shrink after menopause 
      C.  Gross exam shows multiple, well-defined, white, whorled masses that may distort the 
            uterus and impinge on pelvic structures (Fig. 13.10). 
      D.  Usually asymptomatic; when present, symptoms include abnormal uterine bleeding, 
            infertility,  and a pelvic mass.

                                                    XI.  LEIOMYOSARCOMA 
                                                          A.  Malignant  proliferation of smooth muscle arising from the myometrium 
                                                          B.  Arises de novo; leiomyosarcomas do not arise from leiomyomas. 
                                                          C.  Usually seen in postmenopausal women 
                                                          D.  Gross exam often shows a single lesion with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage; 
                                                                histological features include necrosis, mitotic activity, and cellular atypia.

                                                    I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
                                                          A.  The functional  unit of the ovary is the follicle . 
                                                          B.   A follicle consists of an oocyte surrounded by granulosa and theca cells (Fig. 13.11A) 
                                                                1.   LH acts on theca cells to induce androgen production. 
                                                                2.   FSH stimulates granulosa cells to convert androgen to estradiol (drives the 
                                                                      proliferative phase of the endometrial cycle). 
                                                                3.   Estradiol surge induces an LH surge, which leads to ovulation (marking the 
                                                                      beginning of the secretory phase of the endometrial cycle). 
                                                          C.  After  ovulation, the residual follicle becomes a corpus luteum (Fig. l3.11B), which 
                                                                primarily  secretes progesterone (drives the secretory phase which prepares the 
                                                                endometrium for a possible pregnancy). 
                                                                l.    Hemorrhage into a corpus luteum can result in a hemorrhagic corpus luteal cyst, 
                                                                      especially during early pregnancy. 
                                                          D.   Degeneration of follicles results in follicular cysts. Small numbers of follicular cysts 
                                                                are common in women and have no clinical significance.

                                                          A.   Multiple  ovarian follicular cysts due to hormone imbalance 
                                                                l.    Affects roughly 5% of women of reproductive age 
                                                           B.  Characterized by increased LH and low FSH (LH:FSH > 2) 
                                                                 l.   Increased LH induces excess androgen production (from theca cells) resulting in 
                                                                      hirsutism  (excess hair in a male distribution). 
                                                                2.   Androgen is converted to estrone in adipose tissue. 
                                                                      i.    Estrone feedback decreases FSH resulting in cystic degeneration of follicles. 
                                                                      ii.   High  levels of circulating estrone increase risk for endometrial carcinoma. 
                                                           C.  Classic presentation is an obese young woman with infertility, oligomenorrhea, and 
                                                                hirsutism;  some patients have insulin resistance and may develop type 2 diabetes

                                                   OVARIAN    TUMORS 

I.   BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A.  Ovary  is composed of three cell types: surface epithelium, germ cells, and sex cord-
           stroma. 
     B.   Tumor can arise from any of these cell types or from metastases. 


II.  SURFACE EPITHELIAL   TUMORS 
     A.   Most common type of ovarian tumor (70% of cases) 
     B.   Derived from coelomic epithelium that lines the ovary; coelomic epithelium 
           embryologically produces the epithelial lining of the fallopian tube (serous cells), 
           endometrium, and endocervix (mucinous cells). 
     C.  The two most common subtypes of surface epithelial tumors are serous and 
           mucinous; both are usually cystic. 
           1.   Serous tumors are full of watery fluid. 
           2.   Mucinous tumors are full of mucus-like fluid. 
      D.  Mucinous and serous tumors can be benign, borderline, or malignant. 
           l.    Benign tumors (c ystadenomas) are composed of a single cyst with a simple, flat 
                 lining  (Fig. 13.12) ; most commonly arise in premenopausal women (30 - 40 years 
                 old) 
           2.   Malignant tumors (cystadenocarcinomas) are composed of complex cysts with 
                 a thick, shaggy lining; most commonly arise in postmenopausal women (60-70 
                 years old) 
           3.   Borderline tumors have features in between benign and malignant tumors. 
                 i.    Better prognosis than clearly malignant tumors, but still carry metastatic 
                       potential 
           4.   BRCAl mutation carriers have an increased risk for serous carcinoma of the 
                 ovary and fallopian tube. 
                 i.    BRCAl carriers often elect to have a prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy 
                       (along with prophylactic mastectomy due to the increased risk for breast 
                       cancer). 
      E.  Less common subtypes of surface epithelial tumors include endometrioid and 
           Brenner tumor. 
            l.   Endometrioid tumors are composed of endometrial-like glands and are usually 
                 malignant. 
                 i.    May arise from endometriosis 
                 ii.   15% of endometrioid carcinomas of the ovary are associated with an 
                       independent endometrial carcinoma (endometrioid type). 
           2.   Brenner tumors are composed of bladder-like epithelium and are usually benign. 
      F.  Surface tumors clinically present late with vague abdominal symptoms (pain and 
           fullness) or signs of compression (urinary frequency).

                                                                      female genital tract cancers). 
                                                                2.  Epithelial  carcinomas tend to spread locally, especially to the peritoneum. 
                                                          G.  CA-125 is a useful serum marker to monitor treatment response and screen for 
                                                                recurrence.

                                                          A.  2nd most common type of ovarian tumor  (15% of cases) 
                                                          B.  Usually occur in  women of reproductive age 
                                                          C.  Tumor subtypes mimic tissues normally produced by germ cells. 
                                                                1.   Fetal tissue-cystic  teratoma and embryonal carcinoma

                                                                4.   Placental tissue-choriocarcinoma 
                                                          D.  Cystic teratoma 
                                                                1.   Cystic tumor composed offetal tissue derived from two or three embryologic 
                                                                      layers (e.g., skin, hair, bone, cartilage, gut, and thyroid, Fig. 13.13) 
                                                                      i.    Most common germ cell tumor in females; bilateral in 10% of cases 
                                                                2.   Benign, but presence of immature tissue (usually neural) or somatic malignancy 
                                                                      (usually squamous cell carcinoma of skin) indicates malignant potential. 
                                                                3.   Struma ovarii is a teratoma composed primarily of thyroid tissue. 
                                                          E.   Dysgerminoma

     A.   Tumors that resemble sex cord-stromal tissues of the ovary 
     B.   Granulosa-theca cell tumor 
           1.   Neoplastic proliferation of granulosa and theca cells 
           2.   Often produces estrogen; presents with signs of estrogen excess 
                 i.    Prior to puberty-precocious   puberty 
                 ii.   Reproductive age-menorrhagia  or metrorrhagia 
                 iii.  Postmenopause (most common setting for granulosa-theca cell tumors)-
                      endometrial  hyperplasia with postmenopausal uterine bleeding 
           3.   Malignant, but minimal  risk  for metastasis 
     C.  Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor 
           1.   Composed of Sertoli cells that form tubules and Leydig cells (between tubules) 
                 with characteristic Reinke crystals 
           2.   May produce androgen; associated with hirsutism and virilization 
     D.   Fibroma 
           1.   Benign tumor of fibroblasts (Fig. 13.16) 
           2.   Associated with pleural effusions and ascites (Meigs syndrome); syndrome 
                 resolves with removal of tumor. 


V.  METASTASIS 
     A.   Krukenberg tumor is a metastatic mucinous tumor that involves both ovaries; most 
           commonly due to metastatic gastric carcinoma (diffuse type) 
           1.   Bilaterality helps distinguish metastases from primary mucinous carcinoma of 
                 the ovary, which is usually unilateral. 
     B.   Pseudomyxoma peritonei is massive amounts of mucus in the peritoneum. 
           1.   Due to a mucinous tumor of the appendix, usually with metastasis to the ovary 



                                           GESTATIONAL     PATHOLOGY 

I.    ECTOPIC PREGNANCY 
     A.   Implantation of  fertilized ovum at a site other than the uterine wall; most common 
           site is the lumen of the fallopian tube (Fig. 13.17). 
     B.   Key risk factor is scarring (e.g., secondary to pelvic inflammatory disease or 
           endometriosis).

     C.  Classic presentation is lower quadrant abdominal pain a few weeks after a missed 
           period. 
           1.   Surgical emergency; major complications are bleeding into fallopian tube 
                 (hematosalpinx) and rupture. 


II.  SPONTANEOUS  ABORTION 
     A.   Miscarriage of fetus occurring before 20 weeks gestation (usually during first 
           trimester) 
           1.   Common; occurs in up to 1/4 of recognizable pregnancies 
     B.   Presents as vaginal bleeding, cramp-like pain, and passage of fetal tissues 
     C.  Most often due to chromosomal anomalies (especially trisomy 16}; other causes 
           include hypercoagulable states (e.g., antiphospholipid syndrome), congenital 
           infection, and exposure to teratogens (especially during the first 2 weeks of 
           embryogenesis). 
           1.   Effect of teratogens generally depends on the dose, agent, and time of exposure 
                 (Table 12.1). 
                 i.    First two weeks of gestation-spontaneous abortion 
                 ii.   Weeks 3-8-risk   of organ malformation 
                 iii.  Months 3-9-risk    of organ hypoplasia 


III.  PLACENTA PREVIA 
     A.   Implantation of the placenta in the lower uterine segment; placenta overlies cervical 
           os (opening). 
      B.  Presents as third-trimester bleeding 
      C.  Often requires delivery of fetus by caesarian section 


IV. PLACENTAL  ABRUPTION 
      A.  Separation of placenta from the decidua prior to delivery of the fetus (Fig. 13.18} 
      B.  Common cause of still birth 
      C.  Presents with third-trimester bleeding and fetal insufficiency 


V.  PLACENTA  ACCRETA 
      A.  Improper implantation  of placenta into the myometrium with little  or no 
           intervening  decidua 
      B.  Presents with difficult delivery of the placenta and postpartum bleeding

                                        Most common cause of mental retardation; also leads to facial 
   Alcohol 
                                       abnormalities and microcephaly 

   Cocaine                       Intrauterine growth retardation and placental abruption 

   Thalidomide                 Limb defects 

   Cigarette smoke          Intrauterine growth retardation 

   Isotretinoin                   Spontaneous abortion, hearing and visual impairment 

   Tetracycline                 Discolored teeth 

   Warfarin                       Fetal bleeding 

   Phenytoin                     Digit hypoplasia and cleft lip/palate

     C.   Often requires hysterectomy 


VI. PREECLAMPSIA 
     A.   Pregnancy-induced hypertension, proteinuria, and edema, usually arising in the 
           third  trimester; seen in approximately 5% of pregnancies 
           1.   Hypertension may be severe, leading to headaches and visual abnormalities. 
     B.   Due to abnormality of the maternal-fetal vascular interface in the placenta; resolves 
           with  delivery 
      C.  Eclampsia is preeclampsia with seizures. 
     D.   HELLP is preeclampsia with thrombotic microangiopathy involving  the liver; 
           characterized by Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelets 
      E.  Both eclampsia and HELLP usually warrant immediate delivery. 


VII. SUDDEN  INFANT   DEATH  SYNDROME 
      A.  Death of a healthy infant (1 month to 1 year old) without obvious cause 
      B.  Infants usually expire during sleep 
      C.  Risk factors include sleeping on stomach, exposure to cigarette smoke, and 
           prematurity. 


VIII. HYDATIDIFORM     MOLE 
      A.  Abnormal conception characterized by swollen and edematous villi with 
            proliferation of trophoblasts

                                 Some villi are hydropic, and some 
   Villous edema                                                                Most villi are hydropic (Fig. 13.198). 
                                 are normal.

B.  Uterus expands as if a normal pregnancy is present, but the uterus is much larger 
     and             much higher than expected for date of gestation. 
C.  Classically presents in the second trimester as passage of grape-like masses through 
     the vaginal canal (Fig. 13.19A). 
      l.   With  prenatal care, moles are diagnosed by routine ultrasound in the early 
           first trimester. Fetal heart sounds are absent, and a 'snowstorm' appearance is 
           classically seen on ultrasound. 
D.  Classified as complete or partial (Table 12.2) 
E.  Treatment is dilatation and curettage. 
      l.   Subsequent           monitoring  is important  to ensure adequate mole removal 
           and to screen for the development of choriocarcinoma. 
           i.    Choriocarcinoma may arise as a complication of gestation (spontaneous 
                 abortion, normal pregnancy, or hydatidiform mole) or as a spontaneous germ 
                 cell tumor. 
           ii.   Choriocarcinomas that arise from the gestational pathway respond well to 
                 chemotherapy; those that arise from the germ cell pathway do not.

I.  HYPOSPADIAS 
    A. Opening of urethra on inferior surface of penis 
    B. Due to failure of the urethral folds to close 

II. EPISPADIAS 
    A. Opening of urethra on superior surface of penis 
    B. Due to abnormal positioning of the genital tubercle 
    C. Associated with bladder exstrophy 

III. CONDYLOMA ACUMINATUM 
    A. Benign warty growth on genital skin 
    B. Due to HPV type 6 or ll; characterized by koilocytic change (Fig. 14.1)

    B.  Risk factors 
         1. High risk HPV (2/3 of cases) 
         2. Lack of circumcision- Foreskin acts as a nidus for inflammation and irritation if 
              not properly maintained. 
    C. Precursor in situ lesions

I.   BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Arise from germ cells or sex cord-stroma 
     B.   Present as a firm, painless testicular mass that cannot be transilluminated 
     C.  Usually not biopsied due to risk of seeding the scrotum; removed via radical 
           orchiectomy 
           l.    Most testicular tumors are malignant germ cell tumors. 


II.  GERM  CELL TUMORS 
     A.   Most common type of testicular tumor(>  95% of cases) 
     B.   Usually occur between 15 - 40 years of age 
     C.   Risk factors include cryptorchidism and Klinefelter syndrome. 
     D.   Divided into seminoma and nonseminoma 
           l.    Seminomas (55% of cases) are highly responsive to radiotherapy, metastasize late, 
                 and have an excellent prognosis. 
           2.   Nonseminomas (45% of cases) show variable response to treatment and often 
                 metastasize early. 
      E.  Seminoma is a malignant tumor comprised of large cells with clear cytoplasm and 
           central nuclei (resemble spermatogonia, Fig. l4.4A); forms a homogeneous mass 
           with  no hemorrhage or necrosis (Fig. 14.4B) 
           1.   Most common testicular tumor;  resembles ovarian dysgerminoma 
           2.   Rare cases may produce 
           3.   Good prognosis; responds to radiotherapy 
      F.  Embryonal carcinoma is a malignant tumor comprised of immature, primitive  cells 
           that may produce glands (Fig. l4.5A); forms a hemorrhagic mass with necrosis (Fig. 
            l4.5B) 
            1.  Aggressive with early hematogenous spread 
           2.   Chemotherapy may result in differentiation into another type of germ cell tumor 
                 (e .g., teratoma). 
           3.   Increased AFP or            may be present. 
      G.  Yolk sac (endodermal sinus) tumor is a malignant tumor that resembles yolk sac 
           elements. 
            l.   Most common testicular tumor  in children 
           2.   Schiller-Duval bodies (glomerulus-like structures) are seen on histology (Fig. 
                 14.6). 
           3.   AFP is characteristically elevated.

                                                           A.  Tumors that resemble sex cord-stomal tissues of the testicle (Fig. 14.8); usually 
                                                                benign 
                                                          B.   Leydig cell tumor usually produces androgen, causing precocious puberty in 
                                                                children  or gynecomastia in adults. 
                                                                1.   Characteristic Reinke crystals may be seen on histology.

                                                            PROSTATE 

I.   BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Small, round organ that lies at the base of the bladder encircling the urethra 
     B.   Sits anterior to the rectum; posterior aspect of prostate is palpable by digital rectal 
           exam (DRE). 
     C.   Consists of glands and stroma (Fig. 14.9) 
           1.   Glands are composed of an inner layer of luminal cells and an outer layer of 
                 basal cells; secrete alkaline, milky fluid that is added to sperm and seminal 
                 vesicle fluid to make semen. 
           2.   Glands and stroma are maintained by androgens. 


II.  ACUTE  PROSTATITIS 
      A.  Acute inflammation of the prostate; usually due to bacteria 
           1.   Chlamydia trachoma tis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common causes in young 

                 adults. 
           2.   Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas are common causes in older adults. 
      B.  Presents as dysuria with fever and chills 
      C.  Prostate is tender and boggy on digital rectal exam. 
      D.  Prostatic secretions show WBCs; culture reveals bacteria. 


III.  CHRONIC  PROSTATITIS 
      A.  Chronic inflammation  of prostate 
      B.  Presents as dysuria with pelvic or low back pain 
      C.  Prostatic secretions show WBCs, but cultures are negative. 


IV. BENIGN  PROSTATIC  HYPERPLASIA  (BPH) 

      A.  Hyperplasia of prostatic stroma and glands 
      B.  Age-related change (present in most men by the age of 60 years); no increased risk 
           for  cancer 
      C.  Related to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) 

            1.  Testosterone is converted to DHT by Sa-reductase in stromal cells. 
            2.  DHT  acts on the androgen receptor of stromal and epithelial cells resulting in 
                 hyperplastic nodules. 
      D.  Occurs in the central periurethral zone of the prostate 
      E.  Clinical  features include 
            I.   Problems starting and stopping urine stream 
            2.  Impaired  bladder emptying with increased risk for infection and hydronephrosis 

                 (Fig. 14.10)

                                                                      diverticula 
                                                                5.   Microscopic hematuria may be present. 
                                                                6.   Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is often slightly elevated (usually less than 10 ng/ 
                                                                      mL) due to the increased number of glands; PSA is made by prostatic glands and 
                                                                      liquefies semen.

                                                                1.   a1-antagonist (e.g., terazosin) to relax smooth muscle 
                                                                      i.    Also relaxes vascular smooth muscle lowering blood pressure 
                                                                      ii.   Selective a1A-antagonists (e.g., tamsulosin) are used in normotensive 
                                                                                                                effects on blood vessels. 
                                                                            individuals  to avoid a 18

                                                                      i.    Blocks conversion of testosterone to DHT 
                                                                      ii.   Takes months to produce results 
                                                                      iii.  Also useful for male pattern baldness 
                                                                      iv.  Side effects are gynecomastia and sexual dysfunction. 


                                                     V.  PROSTATE ADENOCARCINOMA 
                                                           A.  Malignant  proliferation of prostatic glands 
                                                           B.  Most common cancer in men; 2nd most common cause of cancer-related death 
                                                           C.  Risk factors include age, race (African Americans> Caucasians> Asians), and diet 
                                                                high in  saturated fats. 
                                                           D.  Prostatic carcinoma is most often clinically silent. 
                                                                 1.  Usually arises in the peripheral, posterior region of the prostate and, hence, does 
                                                                      not produce urinary  symptoms early on (Fig. l4.11A) 
                                                                2.   Screening begins at the age of 50 years with DRE and PSA. 
                                                                      i.    Normal  serum PSA increases with age due to BPH (2 .5 ng/mL for ages 40-49 
                                                                            years vs. 7.5 ng/mL for ages 70- 79 years) 
                                                                      ii.   PSA > 10 ng/dL is highly worrisome at any age. 
                                                                      iii.  Decreased% free-PSA is suggestive of cancer (cancer makes bound PSA). 
                                                           E.  Prostatic biopsy is required to confirm the presence of carcinoma. 
                                                                 l.   Shows small, invasive glands with prominent nucleoli (Fig. 14.11B) 
                                                                2.   Gleason grading system is based on architecture alone (and not nuclear atypia). 
                                                                      i.    Multiple  regions of the tumor are assessed because architecture varies from 
                                                                            area to area. 
                                                                      ii.   A score (1 - 5) is assigned for two distinct areas and then added to produce a 
                                                                            final score (2- 10).

G.  Prostatectomy    is performed   for  localized   disease; advanced  disease is  treated  with 
      hormone   suppression  to  reduce  testosterone  and  DHT. 
      1.    Continuous   GnRH   analogs  (e.g., leuprolide)   shut  down  the  hypothalamus    (LH 
             and FSH  are reduced). 
      2.    Flutamide   acts as a competitive   inhibitor    at  the androgen   receptor.

                                                INTRODUCTION 

I.   ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 
     A. Group of glands that maintain body homeostasis 
     B. Functions by release of hormones that travel via blood to distant organs 
     C. "Feedback" mechanisms control hormone release. 


                                    ANTERIOR  PITUITARY  GLAND 

I.   PITUITARY ADENOMA 
     A.  Benign tumor of anterior pituitary cells 
     B.  May be functional (hormone-producing) or nonfunctional (silent) 
          l.   Nonfunctional tumors often present with mass effect. 
               i.   Bitemporal hemianopsia occurs due to compression of the optic chiasm. 
               ii.   Hypopituitarism occurs due to compression of normal pituitary tissue. 
               iii.  Headache 
          2.  Functional tumors present with features based on the type of hormone produced. 
     C. Prolactinoma presents as galactorrhea and amenorrhea (females) or as decreased 
          libido and headache (males); most common type of pituitary adenoma 
          l.   Treatment is dopamine agonists (e.g., bromocriptine or cabergoline) to suppress 
               prolactin production (shrinks tumor) or surgery for larger lesions. 
     D. Growth hormone cell adenoma 
          1.  Giganti min children- increased linear bone growth (epiphyses are not fused) 
          2.  Acromegaly in adults 
               i.   Enlarged bones of hands, feet, and jaw 
               ii.   Growth of visceral organs leading to dysfunction (e.g., cardiac failure) 
               iii.  Enlarged tongue 
          3.  Secondary diabetes mellitus is often present (GH induces liver gluconeogenesis). 
          4.  Diagnosed by elevated GH and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels along with 
               lack of GH suppression by oral glucose 
          5.  Treatment is octreotide (somatostatin analog that suppresses GH release), GH 
               receptor antagonists, or surgery. 
     E.  ACTH cell adenomas secrete ACTH leading to Cushing syndrome (see "Adrenal 
          Cortex" below). 
     F.  TSH cell, LH-producing, and FSH-producing adenomas occur, but are rare. 


II.  HYPOPITUITARISM 
     A.  Insufficient production of hormones by the anterior pituitary gland; symptoms arise 
          when > 75% of the pituitary parenchyma is lost. 
     B.  Causes include 
          l.    Pituitary adenomas (adults) or craniopharyngioma (children)-due to mass 
               effect or pituitary apoplexy (bleeding into an adenoma) 
          2.  Sheehan syndrome-pregnancy-related infarction of the pituitary gland 
               i.    Gland doubles in size during pregnancy, but blood supply does not increase 
                    significantly; blood loss during parturition precipitates infarction. 

167
                 ii.   Presents as poor lactation, loss of pubic hair, and fatigue 
           3.   Empty sella syndrome-congenital  defect of the sella 
                 i.    Herniation of the arachnoid and CSF into the sella compresses and destroys 
                      the pituitary  gland. 
                 ii.   Pituitary gland is "absent" (empty sella) on imaging. 



                                       POSTERIOR    PITUITARY     GLAND 

I.   BASIC  PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Antidiuretic  hormone (ADH) and oxytocin  are made in the hypothalamus and then 
           transported via axons to the posterior pituitary for release. 
           1.   ADH acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney to promote 
                 free water retention. 
           2.   Oxytocin mediates uterine contraction during labor and release of breast milk 
                 (let-down) in lactating mothers. 


II.  CENTRAL   DIABETES INSIPIDUS 
     A.   ADH deficiency 
     B.   Due to hypothalamic or posterior pituitary  pathology (e.g., tumor, trauma, infection, 
           or inflammation) 
     C.  Clinical  features are based on loss of free water. 
           1.   Polyuria and polydipsia with risk of life-threatening  dehydration 
           2.   Hypernatremia and high serum osmolality 
           3.   Low urine osmolality and specific gravity 
     D.  Water deprivation test fails to increase urine osmolality (useful for diagnosis). 
     E.   Treatment is desmopressin (ADH analog). 


III. NEPHROGENIC   DIABETES  INSIPIDUS 
     A.   Impaired renal response to ADH 
     B.   Due to inherited mutations or drugs (e.g., lithium and demeclocycline) 
     C.   Clinical features are similar to central diabetes insipidus, but there is no response to 
           desmopressin. 


IV. SYNDROME  OF INAPPROPRIATE   ADH  (SIADH)  SECRETION 
      A.  Excessive ADH secretion 
      B.  Most often due to ectopic production (e.g., small cell carcinoma of the lung); 
           other causes include CNS trauma, pulmonary infection, and drugs (e.g., 
           cyclophosphamide). 
      C.  Clinical features are based on retention offree water. 
           1.   Hyponatremia and low serum osmolality 
           2.   Mental status changes and seizures-Hyponatremia leads to neuronal swelling 
                 and cerebral edema. 
      D.  Treatment is free water restriction or demeclocycline.

I.    THYROGLOSSAL  DUCT  CYST 
     A.   Cystic dilation of thyroglossal duct remnant 
            1.  Thyroid develops at the base of tongue and then travels along the thyroglossal 
                 duct to the anterior neck. 
           2.   Thyroglossal duct normally involutes; a persistent duct, however, may undergo 
                 cystic dilation. 
      B.  Presents as an anterior neck mass

II.  LINGUAL   THYROID 
     A.   Persistence of thyroid tissue at the base of tongue 
     B.   Presents as a base of tongue mass 



                                                  HYPERTHYROIDISM 

I.   BASIC  PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Increased level of circulating thyroid hormone 
           1.   Increases basal metabolic rate (due to increased synthesis ofNa+ -K+ ATPase) 
           2.   Increases sympathetic nervous system activity (due to increased expression of 
                                      receptors) 
     B.   Clinical features include 
           1.   Weight loss despite increased appetite 
           2.   Heat intolerance and sweating 
           3.   Tachycardia with increased cardiac output 
           4.   Arrhythmia  (e.g., atrial fibrillation),  especially in the elderly 
           5.   Tremor, anxiety, insomnia, and heightened emotions 
           6.   Staring gaze with lid lag

      B.  Leads to increased synthesis and release of thyroid hormone 
            1.  Most common cause of hyperthyroidism 
           2.   Classically occurs in women of childbearing age (20 - 40 years) 
      C.  Clinical features include 
            1.  Hyperthyroidism 
           2.   Diffuse goiter- Constant  TSH stimulation  leads to thyroid hyperplasia and 
                 hypertrophy  (Fig. lS.lA). 
           3.   Exophthalmos and pretibial myxedema 
                 i.    Fibroblasts behind the orbit and overlying the shin express the TSH receptor. 
                 ii.   TSH activation results in glycosaminoglycan (chondroitin sulfate and 
                       hyaluronic acid) buildup, inflammation,  fibrosis, and edema leading to 
                       exophthalmos and pretibial myxedema.

169
     D.  Irregular  follicles with scalloped colloid and chronic inflammation  are seen on 
           histology (Fig. lS.lB). 
     E.  Laboratory findings  include 
           l.    t  total and free T4; ..J.. TSH (free T4 downregulates TRH receptors in the anterior 
                pituitary   to decrease TSH release) 
           2.   Hypocholesterolemia 
           3.   Increased serum glucose 
     F.   Treatment involves P-blockers, thioamide, and radioiodine ablation. 
     G.  Thyroid storm is a potentially fatal complication. 
           l.    Due to elevated catecholamines and massive hormone excess, usually in response

           2.   Presents as arrhythmia, hyperthermia, and vomiting with hypovolemic shock 
           3.   Treatment is propylthiouracil  (PTU), P-blockers, and steroids. 
                 i.    PTU inhibits  peroxidase-mediated oxidation, organification, and coupling 
                                                                                                                                         to 
                      steps of thyroid hormone synthesis, as well as peripheral conversion of T4 
                      T3. 


III. MULTINODULAR     GOITER 
     A.   Enlarged thyroid gland with multiple  nodules (Fig. 15.2) 
     B.   Due to relative iodine deficiency 
     C.  Usually  nontoxic (euthyroid) 
                                                                                                 release and hyperthyroidism 
     D.  Rarely, regions become TSH-independent leading to T4 
           ('toxic goiter'). 



                                                    HYPOTHYROIDISM 

I.    CRETINISM 
      A.  Hypothyroidism  in neonates and infants 
      B.  Characterized by mental retardation, short stature with skeletal abnormalities, 
           coarse facial features, enlarged tongue, and umbilical hernia 
           l.    Thyroid hormone is required for  normal brain and skeletal development. 
      C.  Causes include maternal hypothyroidism during early pregnancy, thyroid agenesis, 
           dyshormonogenetic goiter, and iodine deficiency. 

            l.   Dyshormonogenetic goiter is due to a congenital defect in thyroid hormone 
                 production;  most commonly involves thyroid peroxidase 


II.   MYXEDEMA 
      A.  Hypothyroidism  in older children  or adults 
      B.  Clinical  features are based on decreased basal metabolic rate and decreased 
           sympathetic nervous system activity. 
            l.   Myxedema-accumulation   of glycosaminoglycans in the skin and soft tissue; 
                 results in a deepening of voice and large tongue 
           2.   Weight gain despite normal appetite 
           3.   Slowing of mental activity 
           4.   Muscle weakness 
           5.   Cold intolerance with  decreased sweating 
           6.   Bradycardia with decreased cardiac output, leading to shortness of breath and 
                 fatigue 
           7.   Oligomenorrhea 
           8.   Hypercholesterolemia 
           9.   Constipation 
      C.  Most common causes are iodine deficiency and Hashimoto thyroiditis; other causes 
           include drugs (e.g., lithium) and surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid.

                                                         THYROIDITIS 

I.   HASHIMOTO    THYROIDITIS 
     A.   Autoimmune destruction of the thyroid  gland; associated with HLA-DR5 
           l.    Most common cause of hypothyroidism in regions where iodine levels are 
                 adequate 
     B.   Clinical features 
           l.    Initially  may present as hyperthyroidism (due to follicle damage) 
           2.   Progresses to hypothyroidism; ..!.. T4 and t TSH 
           3.   Antithyroglobulin   and antimicrosomal antibodies are often present (sign of 
                 thyroid damage). 
     C.   Chronic inflammation  with germinal centers and Hurthle cells (eosinophilic 
           metaplasia of cells that line follicles) is seen on histology (Fig. 15.3). 
      D.  Increased risk forB-cell (marginal zone) lymphoma; presents as an enlarging 
           thyroid  gland late in disease course 


II.   SUBACUTE GRANULOMATOUS    (DE QUERVAIN)  THYROIDITIS 
      A.  Granulomatous thyroiditis  that follows a viral infection 
      B.  Presents as a tender thyroid with transient hyperthyroidism 
      C.  Self-limited; does not progress to hypothyroidism 


III.  REIDEL  FIBROSING THYROIDITIS 
      A.  Chronic inflammation  with  extensive fibrosis of the thyroid gland 
      B.  Presents as hypothyroidism with a 'hard as wood,' non tender thyroid gland 
      C.  Fibrosis may extend to involve local structures (e .g., airway). 
            1.  Clinically  mimics anaplastic carcinoma, but patients are younger (40s), and 
                 malignant  cells are absent 



                                                 THYROID    NEOPLASIA 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
      A.  Usually presents as a distinct, solitary nodule 
            1.  Thyroid  nodules are more likely to be benign than malignant. 
      B.  131 I radioactive uptake studies are useful to further characterize nodules. 
            1.  Increased uptake ('hot' nodule) is seen in Graves disease or nodular goiter. 
            2.  Decreased uptake ('cold' nodule) is seen in adenoma and carcinoma; often 
                 warrants biopsy 
      C.  Biopsy is performed by fine needle aspiration (FNA). 


II.   FOLLICULAR   ADENOMA 
      A.  Benign proliferation  of follicles surrounded by a fibrous capsule (Fig. 15.4)

                                                          B.  Usually nonfunctional; less commonly, may secrete thyroid hormone 


                                                    III.  PAPILLARY  CARCINOMA 
                                                          A.  Most common type of thyroid carcinoma (SO% of cases) 
                                                          B.  Exposure to ionizing radiation in  childhood is a major risk factor. 
                                                          C.  Comprised of papillae lined by cells with clear, 'Orphan Annie eye' nuclei and 
                                                               nuclear grooves (Fig. 15.5A); papillae are often associated with psammoma bodies 
                                                                (Fig. 15.5B). 
                                                          D.  Often spreads to cervical (neck) lymph nodes, but prognosis is excellent (10 -year 
                                                                survival>  95%) 


                                                    IV.  FOLLICULAR  CARCINOMA 
                                                          A.  Malignant  proliferation of follicles surrounded by a fibrous capsule with invasion 
                                                                through the capsule (Fig. 15.6) 
                                                                1.  Invasion through  the capsule helps distinguish follicular carcinoma from 
                                                                     follicular  adenoma. 
                                                                2.  Entire  capsule must be examined microscopically. 
                                                                3.   FNA only examines cells and not the capsule; hence, a distinction between 
                                                                      follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma cannot be made by FNA. 
                                                          B.  Metastasis generally occurs hematogenously. 


                                                    V.   MEDULLARY  CARCINOMA 
                                                          A.  Malignant  proliferation  of para follicular C cells; comprises 5% of thyroid 
                                                                carcinomas 
                                                                l.    C cells are neuroendocrine cells that secrete calcitonin. 
                                                                2.   Calcitonin lowers serum calcium by increasing renal calcium excretion but is 
                                                                      inactive at normal physiologic levels. 
                                                                3.   High levels of calcitonin produced by tumor may lead to hypocalcemia. 
                                                                4.   Calcitonin often deposits within the tumor as amyloid. 
                                                          B.   Biopsy reveals sheets of malignant cells in an amyloid stroma (Fig. 15.7). 
                                                          C.  Familial  cases are often due to multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A and 2B, 
                                                                which are associated with mutations in the RET oncogene. 
                                                                1.   MEN 2 results in medullary carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and parathyroid 
                                                                      adenomas (2A) or ganglioneuromas of the oral mucosa (2B). 
                                                                2.   Detection of the RET mutation warrants prophylactic thyroidectomy. 


                                                     VI. ANAPLASTIC   CARCINOMA 
                                                          A.   Undifferentiated malignant tumor  of the thyroid (Fig. 15.8); usually seen in elderly 
                                                          B.   Often invades local structures, leading to dysphagia or respiratory compromise 
                                                          C.   Poor prognosis

                                               PARATHYROID     GLANDS 

I.   BASIC  PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Chief cells regulate serum free (ionized) calcium via parathyroid hormone (PTH) 
           secretion, which 
           l.    Increases bone osteoclast activity, releasing calcium and phosphate 
           2.   Increases small bowel absorption of calcium and phosphate (indirectly by 
                 activating vitamin  D) 
           3.   Increases renal calcium reabsorption (distal tubule) and decreases phosphate 
                 reabsorption (proximal  tubule) 
      B.  Increased serum ionized calcium levels provide negative feedback to decrease PTH 
           secretion. 


II.   PRIMARY  HYPERPARATHYROIDISM 
      A.  Excess PTH due to a disorder of the parathyroid gland itself 
      B.  Most common cause is parathyroid adenoma (>80% of cases); sporadic parathyroid 
           hyperplasia and parathyroid carcinoma are less common causes. 
      C.  Parathyroid adenoma is a benign neoplasm, usually involving one gland. 
            l.   Most often results in asymptomatic hypercalcemia; however, may present with 
                 consequences of increased PTH and hypercalcemia such as 
                 i.    Nephrolithiasis  (calcium oxalate stones) 
                 ii.   Nephrocalcinosis-metastatic   calcification of  renal tubules (Fig. 15.9), 
                       potentially leading to renal insufficiency and polyuria 
                 iii.  CNS disturbances (e.g., depression and seizures) 
                 iv.  Constipation,  peptic ulcer disease, and acute pancreatitis 
                 v.   Osteitis fibrosa cystica-resorption   of bone leading to fibrosis and cystic 
                       spaces (Fig. 15.10) 
            2.  Laboratory findings  include i  serum PTH, i  serum calcium, ,J.. serum 
                 phosphate, i  urinary cAMP, and i   serum alkaline phosphatase. 
            3.  Treatment involves surgical removal of the affected gland. 


III.  SECONDARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM 
      A.  Exces production  of PTH due to a disease process extrinsic to the parathyroid gland 
      B.  Most common cause is chronic renal failure. 
            1.  Renal insufficiency leads to decreased phosphate excretion. 
            2.  i   serum phosphate binds free calcium. 
            3.  ,J.. free calcium stimulates all four parathyroid glands. 
            4.  i   PTH leads to bone resorption (contributing to renal osteodystrophy). 
            5.  Lab findings include i   PTH, .J.. serum calcium, i serum phosphate, and i 
                 alkaline  phosphatase.

                                                     IV. HYPOPARATHYROIDISM 
                                                          A.   LowPTH 
                                                          B.   Causes include autoimmune damage to the parathyroids, surgical excision, and 
                                                                DiGeorge syndrome 
                                                          C.   Presents with symptoms related to low serum calcium 
                                                                1.   Numbness and tingling (particularly  circumoral) 
                                                                2.   Muscle spasms (tetany)-may be elicited with filling  of a blood pressure cuff 
                                                                      (Trousseau sign) or tapping on the facial nerve (Chvostek sign) 
                                                          D.   Labs reveal ,!. PTH levels and ,!. serum calcium. 
                                                          E.   Pseudohypoparathyroidism is due to end-organ resistance to PTH. 
                                                                1.   Labs reveal hypocalcemia with t PTH levels. 
                                                                2.   Autosomal dominant  form is associated with short stature and short 4th and 5th 
                                                                      digits. 



                                                                                                    ENDOCRINE     PANCREAS 

                                                     I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
                                                           A.  Composed of clusters of cells termed islets ofLangerhans (Fig. 15.11) 
                                                           B.  A single islet consists of multiple cell types, each producing one type of hormone. 
                                                           C.  Insulin  is secreted by beta cells, which lie in the center of the islets. 
                                                                 1.  Major  anabolic hormone; upregulates insulin-dependent glucose transporter 
                                                                      protein  (GLUT4) on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue (glucose uptake by 
                                                                      GLUT4 decreases serum glucose) 
                                                                2.   Increased glucose uptake by tissues leads to increased glycogen synthesis, protein 
                                                                      synthesis, and lipogenesis. 
                                                           D.  Glucagon is secreted by alpha cells; it opposes insulin in order to increase blood 
                                                                glucose levels (e.g., in states of fasting) via glycogenolysis and lipolysis. 


                                                     II.   TYPE 1 DIABETES  MELLITUS 
                                                           A.  Insulin  deficiency leading to a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia 
                                                           B.  Due to autoimmune destruction of beta cells by T lymphocytes 
                                                                 1.  Characterized by inflammation  of islets 
                                                                 2.  Associated with HLA-DR3  and HLA-DR4 
                                                                 3.  Autoantibodies against insulin  are often present (sign of damage) and may be 
                                                                      seen years before clinical disease develops. 
                                                           C.  Manifests in childhood  with clinical  features of insulin deficiency 
                                                                 1.  High  serum glucose-Lack  of insulin  leads to decreased glucose uptake by fat 
                                                                      and skeletal muscle. 



















Fig. 15.10 Osteitis fibrosa cystica.            Fig. 15.11 Islets oflangerhans.                  Fig. 15.12 Amyloid in islets, type II DM. 

174
           2.  Weight loss, low muscle mass, and polyphagia-Unopposed glucagon leads 
                to gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis and lipolysis, which further exacerbates 
                hyperglycemia. 
           3.  Polyuria, polydipsia, and glycosuria-Hyperglycemia  exceeds renal ability to 
                resorb glucose; excess filtered glucose leads to osmotic diuresis. 
           4.  Treatment involves lifelong insulin. 
     D.  Risk for diabetic ketoacidosis 
           l.    Characterized by excessive serum ketones 
           2.  Often arises with stress (e.g., infection); epinephrine stimulates glucagon 
                secretion increasing lipolysis (along with gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis). 
                i.    Increased lipolysis leads to increased free fatty acids (FFAs). 
                ii.    Liver converts FFAs to ketone bodies                           acid and acetoacetic 
                      acid). 
           3.   Results in hyperglycemia(> 300 mg/dL), anion gap metabolic acidosis, and 
                hyperkalemia 
           4.   Presents with Kussmaul respirations, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, mental 
                 status changes, and fruity smelling breath (due to acetone) 
           5.   Treatment is fluids (corrects dehydration from polyuria), insulin, and 
                 replacement of electrolytes (e.g., potassium). 


Ill.  TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS 
     A.   End-organ insulin resistance leading to a metabolic disorder characterized by 
           hyperglycemia 
           1.   Most common type of diabetes (90% of cases); affects 5- 10% of the US 
                 population 
           2.   Incidence is rising. 
     B.   Arises in middle-aged, obese adults 
           1.   Obesity leads to decreased numbers of insulin receptors. 
           2.   Strong genetic predisposition exists. 
     C.   Insulin levels are increased early in disease, but later, insulin deficiency develops due 
           to beta cell exhaustion; histology reveals amyloid deposition in the islets (Fig. 15. 12). 
     D.   Clinical fe atures include polyuria, polydipsia, and hyperglycemia, but disease is 
           often clinically silent. 
     E.   Diagnosis is made by measuring glucose levels (normal is 70-120 mg/dL). 
           1.   Random glucose > 200 mg/dL 
           2.   Fasting glucose > 126 mg/dL 
           3.   Glucose tolerance test with a serum glucose level > 200 mg/dL two hours after 
                 glucose loading 
      F.  Treatment involves weight loss (diet and exercise) initially; may require drug therapy 
           to counter insulin  resistance (e.g., sulfonylureas or metformin) or exogenous insulin 
           after exhaustion of beta cells 
      G. Risk for hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma 
           l.    High glucose(> 500 mg/dL) leads to life-threatening diuresis with hypotension 
                 and coma. 
           2.   Ketones are absent due to small amounts of circulating insulin. 


IV. LONG-TERM  CONSEQUENCES OF DIABETES 
      A.  Nonenzymatic glycosylation (NEG) of the vascular basement membrane 
           l.    NEG oflarge- and medium-sized vessels leads to atherosclerosis and its resultant 
                 complications. 
                 i.    Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among diabetics. 
                 ii .  Peripheral vascular disease in diabetics is the leading cause of nontraumatic 
                       amputations. 

175
           2.  NEG of small vessels (arterioles) leads to hyaline arteriolosclerosis (Fig. 15.13A). 
                 i.   Involvement of renal arterioles leads to glomerulosclerosis, resulting in small, 
                      scarred kidneys with a granular surface (Fig. 15.13B). 
                 ii.   Preferential involvement of efferent arterioles leads to glomerular 
                      hyperfiltration   injury with  microalbuminuria  that eventually progresses 
                      to nephrotic syndrome; characterized by Kimmelstiel-Wilson  nodules in 
                      glomeruli 
           3.   NEG of hemoglobin produces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), a marker of 
                 glycemic control. 
     B.   Osmotic damage 
           1.   Glucose freely enters into Schwann cells (which myelinate peripheral nerves), 
                 pericytes of retinal blood vessels, and the lens. 
           2.   Aldose reductase converts glucose to sorbitol, resulting in osmotic damage. 
           3.   Leads to peripheral neuropathy, impotence, blindness, and cataracts; diabetes is 
                 the leading cause of blindness in the developed world. 


V.  PANCREATIC  ENDOCRINE   NEOPLASMS 
     A.   Tumors of islet cells; account for < 5% of pancreatic neoplasms. 
           1.   Often a component of MEN 1 along with parathyroid hyperplasia and pituitary 
                 adenomas 
     B.   Insulinomas present as episodic hypoglycemia with mental status changes that are 
           relieved by administration of glucose. 
           1.   Diagnosed by -l.. serum glucose levels (usually < 50 mg/dL), t insulin, and t 
                 C-peptide 
     C.  Gastrinomas present as treatment-resistant peptic ulcers (Zollinger-Ellison 
           syndrome); ulcers may be multiple and can extend into the jejunum. 
     D.  Somatostatinomas present as achlorhydria (due to inhibition of gastrin) and 
           cholelithiasis with steatorrhea (due to inhibition of cholecystokinin). 
      E.  VIPomas secrete excessive vasoactive intestinal peptide leading to watery diarrhea, 
           hypokalemia, and achlorhydria. 



                                                    ADRENAL     CORTEX 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
      A.  Composed of three layers that each secrete distinct hormones 
           1.   Glomerulosa produces mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone). 
           2.   Fasciculata produces glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol). 
           3.   Reticularis produces sex steroids (e. g., testosterone). 



















             Fig. 15.13 Complications of diabetes. A, Hyaline arteriolosclerosis. 8, Glomerulosclerosis. 

176
II.  HYPERCORTISOLISM   (CUSHING  SYNDROME) 
     A.   Excess cortisol 
     B.   Clinical features 
           I.    Muscle weakness with thin extremities- Cortisol  breaks down muscle for 
                 gluconeogenesis. 
           2.   Moon facies, buffalo hump, and truncal obesity-High   insulin (due to high 
                 glucose) increases storage of fat. 
           3.   Abdominal striae-due   to impaired synthesis of collagen with thinning of skin 
           4.   Hypertension 
           5.   Osteoporosis 
           6.   Immune suppression 
      C.  Diagnosis is made by increased 24-hour urine cortisol levels. 
      D.  Causes include 
           I.    Exogenous corticosteroids-leads to bilateral adrenal atrophy; steroids suppress 
                 ACTH secretion (negative feedback). 
           2.   Primary adrenal adenoma, hyperplasia, or carcinoma-leads to atrophy of the 
                 uninvolved adrenal gland 
           3.   ACTH-secreting pituitary  adenoma- leads to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia 
           4.   Paraneoplastic ACTH secretion (e.g., small cell carcinoma of the lung)-leads to 
                 bilateral adrenal hyperplasia 
      E.  High-dose dexamethasone (cortisol analog) suppresses ACTH production by a 
           pituitary  adenoma (cortisol levels decrease), but fails to suppress ectopic ACTH 
           production  by a small cell lung carcinoma (cortisol levels remain high). 


Ill.  HYPERALDOSTERONISM    (CONN SYNDROME) 
      A.  Excess aldosterone 
      B.  Presents as hypertension with hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis 
            I.   Aldosterone increases sodium absorption and secretion of potassium and 
                 hydrogen ions (distal tubules and collecting duct). 
            2.  Increased absorption of sodium expands plasma volume leading to hypertension. 
      C.  Primary hyperaldosteronism is most commonly due to an adrenal adenoma; 
            sporadic adrenal hyperplasia and adrenal carcinoma are less common causes. 
            I.   Characterized by high aldosterone and low renin (high blood pressure 
                 downregulates renin via negative feedback) 
      D.  Secondary hyperaldosteronism is seen with activation of the renin-angiotensin 
            system (e.g., renovascular hypertension or CHF). 
            I.   Characterized by high aldosterone and high renin 


IV.  CONGENITAL  ADRENAL   HYPERPLASIA 
      A.  Excess sex steroids with hyperplasia of both adrenal glands 
      B.  Inherited 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause. 
            I.   21-hydroxylase is required for the production of aldosterone and corticosteroids. 
            2.  In enzyme deficiency, steroidogenesis is predominantly shunted toward sex 
                 steroid production (which does not require 21-hydroxylase). 
            3.  Deficiency of cortisol leads to increased ACTH secretion (lack of negative 
                 feedback), which results in bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. 
      C.  Clinical  features include 
            I.   Salt wasting with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypovolemia due to lack of 
                 aldosterone. 
            2.   Life-threatening hypotension due to lack of cortisol. 
            3.  Clitoral  enlargement (females) or precocious puberty (males) due to excess 
                 androgens 

177
V.  ADRENAL  INSUFFICIENCY 
     A.   Lack of adrenal hormones 
     B.   Acute insufficiency may arise with Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome. 
           1.   Characterized by hemorrhagic necrosis of the adrenal glands (Fig. 15.14), 
                 classically due to DIC in young children with N meningitidis infection 
           2.   Lack of cortisol exacerbates hypotension, often leading to death. 
     C.   Chronic insufficiency (Addison disease) is due to progressive destruction of the 
           adrenal glands. 
           1.   Common causes include autoimmune destruction (most common cause in 
                 the West), TB (most common cause in the developing world), and metastatic 
                 carcinoma (e .g., arising from lung). 
           2.   Clinical  features include hypotension, hyponatremia, hypovolemia, 
                 hyperkalemia, weakness, hyperpigmentation (increased ACTH by-products 
                 stimulate melanocytic production  of pigment), vomiting, and diarrhea. 



                                                  ADRENAL     MEDULLA 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
      A.  Composed of neural crest-derived chromaffin cells 
      B.  Main  physiologic source of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) 


II.   PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA 
      A.  Tumor of chromaffin  cells (Fig. 15.15) 
      B.  Clinical  features are due to increased serum catecholamines. 
            1.  Episodic hypertension, headache, palpitations, tachycardia, and sweating 
      C.  Diagnosed by increased serum metanephrines and increased 24-hour urine 
           metanephrines and vanillylmandelic  acid 
      D.  Treatment is surgical excision. 

            1.  Catecholamines may leak into the bloodstream upon manipulation of the tumor. 
            2.  Phenoxybenzamine (irreversible a-blocker) is administered perioperatively to 
                 prevent a hypertensive crisis. 
      E.  Often follows the 'rule of  lOs:' 10% bilateral, 10% familial, 10% malignant, and 10% 
           located outside of the adrenal medulla (e .g., bladder wall or organ of Zuckerkandl at 
            the inferior mesenteric artery root) 
      F.  Associated with MEN  2A and 2B, von Hippel-Lindau disease, and neurofibromatosis 
            type 1

                              Breast                Pathology 







                                                INTRODUCTION 

I.   BREAST 
     A. Modified sweat gland embryologically derived from the skin 
          1.  Breast tissue can develop anywhere along the milk line, which runs from the 
               axilla to the vulva (e.g., supernumerary nipples). 
     B. The terminal duct lobular unit is the functional unit of the breast (Fig. 16.1); lobules 
          make milk that drains via ducts to the nipple. 
     C. Lobules and ducts are lined by two layers of epithelium. 
          1.  Luminal cell layer-inner cell layer lining the ducts and lobules; responsible for 
               milk production in the lobules 
          2.  Myoepithelial cell layer-outer cell layer lining ducts and lobules; contractile 
               function propels milk towards the nipple. 
     D. Breast tissue is hormone sensitive. 
          1.  Before puberty, male and female breast tissue primarily consists of large ducts 
               under the nipple. 
          2.  Development after menarche is primarily driven by estrogen and progesterone; 
               lobules and small ducts form and are present in highest density in the upper 
               outer quadrant. 
          3.  Breast tenderness during the menstrual cycle is a common complaint, especially 
               prior to menstruation. 
          4.  During pregnancy, breast lobules undergo hyperplasia. 
               i.   Hyperplasia is driven by estrogen and progesterone produced by the corpus 
                    luteum (early first trimester), fetus, and placenta (later in pregnancy) 
          5.  After menopause, breast tissue undergoes atrophy. 
     E.  Galactorrhea refers to milk production outside of lactation. 
          1.  It is not a symptom of breast cancer. 
          2.  Causes include nipple stimulation (common physiologic cause), prolactinoma of 
               the anterior pituitary (common pathologic cause), and drugs. 


                                   INFLAMMATORY    CONDITIONS 

I.   ACUTE MASTITIS 
     A.  Bacterial infection of the breast, usually due to Staphylococcus au reus 
     B.  Associated with breast-feeding; fissures develop in the nipple providing a route of 
          entry for microbes. 
     C.  Presents as an erythematous breast with purulent nipple discharge; may progress to 
          abscess formation 
     D. Treatment involves continued drainage (e .g., feeding) and antibiotics (e .g., 
          dicloxacillin). 


II.  PERIDUCTAL MASTITIS 
     A.  In flam mat ion of the subareolar ducts 
     B.  Usually seen in smokers

                                                               1.   Relative vitamin A deficiency results in squamous metaplasia of lactiferous 
                                                                     ducts, producing duct blockage and inflammation. 
                                                          C.  Clinically presents as a subareolar mass with nipple retraction 


                                                    III.  MAMMARY   DUCT  ECTASIA 
                                                          A.  Inflammation  with dilation  (ectasia) of the subareolar ducts 
                                                                1.  Rare; classically arises in multiparous postmenopausal women 
                                                          B.  Presents as a periareolar mass with green-brown nipple discharge (inflammatory 
                                                               debris) 
                                                                1.  Chronic inflammation  with  plasma cells is seen on biopsy. 


                                                    IV. FAT NECROSIS 
                                                          A.  Necrosis of breast fat 
                                                          B.  Usually related to trauma; however, a history of trauma may not always be evident. 
                                                          C.  Presents as a mass on physical exam or abnormal calcification on mammography 
                                                                (due to saponification) 
                                                          D.  Biopsy shows necrotic fat with associated calcifications and giant cells. 



                                                                           BENIGN   TUMORS    AND   FIBROCYSTIC     CHANGES 

                                                    I.    FIBROCYSTIC  CHANGE 
                                                          A.  Development of fibrosis and cysts in the breast 
                                                                1.  Most common change in the premenopausal breast; thought to be hormone 
                                                                     mediated 
                                                          B.  Presents as vague irregularity of the breast tissue ('lumpy breast'), usually in the 
                                                                upper outer quadrant 
                                                          C.  Cysts have a blue-dome appearance on gross exam. 
                                                          D.  Benign, but some fibr ocystic-related changes are ass ociated with an increased risk 
                                                                for invasive carcinoma (increased risk applies to both breasts) 

                                                                1.  Fibrosis, cysts, and apocrine metaplasia (Fig. 16.2)-no increased risk 
                                                                2.  Ductal  hyperplasia and sclerosing adenosis-2x increased risk 
                                                                3.   Atypical hyperplasia-Sx  increased risk 


                                                    II.   INTRADUCTAL    PAPILLOMA 
                                                          A.  Papillary growth,  usually into a large duct 
                                                          B.  Characterized by fibrovascular projections lined by epithelial (luminal) and 
                                                                myoepithelial cells 
                                                          C.  Classically presents as bloody nipple discharge in a premenopausal woman 
                                                          D.  Must be distinguished from papillary carcinoma, which also presents as bloody 
                                                                nipple discharge

           1.   Papillary carcinoma is characterized by fibrovascular projections lined by 
                 epithelial cells without underlying myoepithelial  cells. 
           2.   Risk of papillary carcinoma increases with age; thus, it is more commonly seen 
                 in postmenopausal women. 


III. FIBROADENOMA 
     A.   Tumor of fibrous tissue and glands (Fig. 16.3) 
     B.   Most common benign neoplasm of the breast; usually seen in premenopausal 
           women 
     C.   Presents as a well-circumscribed, mobile marble-like mass 
     D.   Estrogen sensitive- grows during pregnancy and may be painful during the 
           menstrual cycle 
     E.   Benign, with no increased risk of carcinoma 


IV. PHYLLODES  TUMOR 
      A.  Fibroadenoma-like tumor with  overgrowth of the fibrous component; characteristic 
           'leaf-like'  projections are seen on biopsy (Fig. 16.4). 
      B.  Most commonly seen in postmenopausal women 
      C.  Can be malignant in some cases 



                                                      BREAST   CANCER 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
      A.  Most common carcinoma in women by incidence (excluding skin cancer) 
      B.  2nd most common cause of cancer mortality in women 
      C.  Risk factors are mostly related to estrogen exposure. 
            1.  Female gender 
           2.   Age-Cancer   usually arises in postmenopausal women, with the notable 
                 exception of hereditary breast cancer. 
           3.   Early menarche/late menopause 
           4.   Obesity 
            5.  Atypical  hyperplasia 
           6.   First -degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter) with breast cancer 


II.   DUCTAL  CARCINOMA   IN  SITU  (DCIS) 
      A.  Malignant  pro! iferation of cells in ducts with no invasion of the basement membrane 
      B.  Often detected as calcification on mammography; DCIS does not usually produce a 
            mass. 
            1.  Mammographic  calcifications can also be associated with benign conditions 
                 such as fibrocystic changes (especially sclerosing adenosis) and fat necrosis.

                                      FU 



           2.   Biopsy of calcifications is often necessary to distinguish between benign and 
                 malignant conditions. 
     C.  Histologic  subtypes are based on architecture; comedo type is characterized by 
           high-grade cells with necrosis and dystrophic calcification in the center of ducts (Fig. 
           16.5). 
     D.  Paget disease of the breast is DCIS that extends up the ducts to involve the skin of 
           the nipple (Fig. 16.6). 
           1.   Presents as nipple ulceration and erythema 
           2.   Paget disease of the breast is almost always associated with an underlying 
                 carcinoma. 


III.  INVASIVE  DUCTAL  CARCINOMA 
     A.   Invasive carcinoma that classically forms duct-like structures 
     B.   Most common type of invasive carcinoma in the breast, accounting for > 80% of 
           cases 
     C.   Presents as a mass detected by physical exam or by mammography 
           1.   Clinically  detected masses are usually 2 em or greater. 
           2.   Mammographically  detected masses are usually 1 em or greater. 
           3.   Advanced tumors may result in dimpling of the skin or retraction  of the nipple. 
     D.   Biopsy usually shows duct-like structures in a desmoplastic stroma; special subtypes 
           of invasive ductal carcinoma include 
           1.   Tubular carcinoma-characterized   by well-differentiated tubules that lack 
                 myoepithelial cells (Fig. 16.7A); relatively good prognosis 
           2.   Mucinous carcinoma-characterized   by carcinoma with abundant extracellular 
                 mucin ('tumor  cells floating in a mucus pool', Fig. 16.7B)

                   i.     Tends to  occur  in  older  women  (average  age is 70 years) 
                   ii.    Relatively  good  prognosis 
            3.    Medullary    carcinoma-characterized         by large,  high-grade   cells  growing   in 
                   sheets with   associated  lymphocytes   and  plasma  cells 
                   i.     Grows  as a well-circumscribed     mass  that can  mimic   fibroadenoma    on 
                          mammography 
                   ii.    Relatively  good  prognosis 
                   iii.   Increased   incidence  in  BRCA1  carriers 
            4.    Inflammatory     carcinoma-characterized         by carcinoma   in  dermal   lymphatics 
                   (Fig.  16.8) 
                   i.     Presents classically   as an inflamed,    swollen  breast  (tumor   cells block  drainage 
                          of lymphatics)    with  no  discrete  mass; can  be mistaken   for  acute  mastitis 
                   ii.    Poor  prognosis 


IV.  LOBULAR     CARCINOMA      IN  SITU    (LCIS) 
      A.   Malignant    proliferation     of cells  in  lobules  with   no invasion   of the  basement 
             membrane 
      B.   LCIS  does not  produce   a mass or calcifications    and  is usually   discovered  incidentally 
             on biopsy. 
      C.   Characterized    by dyscohesive  cells  lacking   E-cadherin   adhesion   protein 
      D.   Often  multifocal     and bilateral 
      E.   Treatment   is  tamoxifen   (to  reduce  the risk  of  subsequent  carcinoma)   and  close 
             follow-up;   low  risk  of  progression   to invasive  carcinoma 


V.   INVASIVE     LOBULAR     CARCINOMA 
      A.   Invasive   carcinoma   that  characteristically     grows  in  a single-file   pattern   (Fig.  16.9); 
             cells may  exhibit   signet-ring   morphology. 

             1.   No  duct  formation    due  to lack  ofE-cadherin. 


VI.  PROGNOSTIC     AND    PREDICTIVE      FACTORS 
      A.   Prognosis   in  breast cancer  is based  on TNM    staging. 

             1.   Metastasis   is the  most  important   factor,  but  most  patients   present before 
                   metastasis  occurs. 
             2.   Spread  to axillary    lymph   nodes is  the most  useful  prognostic   factor   (given  that 
                    metastasis  is not  common   at presentation);   sentinel   lymph   node biopsy   is used to 
                   assess axillary   lymph   nodes. 
      B.    Predictive   factors  predict   response to  treatment. 

             1.   Most   important    factors  are estrogen   receptor  (ER),  progesterone  receptor   (PR), 
                   and  HER2/neu   gene amplification     (overexpression)   status.

183
           2.  Presence of ER and PR is associated with response to antiestrogenic agents (e.g., 
                tamoxifen); both receptors are located in the nucleus (Fig. 16.10). 
           3.   HER2/neu amplification is associated with response to trastuzumab (Hercepti n), 
                 a designer antibody directed against the HER2 receptor; HER2/neu is a growth 
                 factor receptor present on the cell surface (Fig. 16.11). 
           4.   'Triple-negative' tumors are negative for ER, PR, and HER2/neu and have a poor 
                 prognosis; African American women have an increased propensity to develop 
                 triple-negative carcinoma. 


VII. HEREDITARY  BREAST  CANCER 
     A.   Represents 10% of breast cancer cases 
     B.   Clinical features that suggest hereditary breast cancer include multiple first-degree 
           relatives with breast cancer, tumor at an early age (premenopausal), and multiple 
           tumors in a single patient. 
     C.   BRCAJ and BRCA2 mutations are the most important single gene mutations 
           associated with hereditary breast cancer. 
           I.    BRCAl mutation is associated with breast and ovarian carcinoma. 
           2.   BRCA2 mutation is associated with breast carcinoma in males. 
     D.  Women with  a genetic propensity to develop breast cancer may choose to undergo 
           removal of both breasts (bilateral mastectomy) to decrease the risk of developing 
           carcinoma. 
           1.   A small risk for cancer remains because breast tissue sometimes extends into the 
                 axilla or subcutaneous tissue of the chest wall. 


VIII. MALE  BREAST CANCER 
     A.   Breast cancer is rare in males (represents 1% of all breast cancers). 
      B.  Usually presents as a subareolar mass in older males 
           l.    Highest density of breast tissue in males is underneath the nipple. 
           2.   May produce nipple discharge 
      C.  Most common histological subtype is invasive ductal carcinoma. 
           1.   Lobular carcinoma is rare (the male breast develops very few lobules). 
      D.  Associated with BRCA2 mutations and Klinefelter syndrome

                                  DEVELOPMENTAL  ANOMALIES 

I.   NEURAL TUBE DEFECTS 
     A. Arise from incomplete closure of the neural tube 
          1.  Neural plate invaginates early in gestation to form the neural tube, which runs 
               along the cranial-caudal axis of the embryo. 
          2.  The wall of the neural tube forms central nervous system tissue, the hollow 
               lumen forms the ventricles and spinal cord canal, and the neural crest forms the 
               peripheral nervous system. 
     B. Associated with low folate levels prior to conception 
     C. Detected during prenatal care by elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels in the 
          amniotic fluid and maternal blood 
     D. Anencephaly is absence of the skull and brain (disruption of the cranial end of the 
          neural tube). 
          1.  Leads to a 'frog-like' appearance of the fetus (Fig. 17.1) 
          2.  Results in maternal polyhydramnios since fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid is 
               impaired 
     E. Spina bifida is failure of the posterior vertebral arch to close, resulting in a vertebral 
          defect (disruption of the caudal end of the neural tube). 
          1.  Spina bifida occulta presents as a dimple or patch of hair overlying the vertebral 
               defect. 
          2.  Spina bifida presents with cystic protrusion of the underlying tissue through the 
               vertebral defect. 
               i.   Meningocele- protrusion of meninges 
               ii.  Meningomyelocele-protrusion of meninges and spinal cord 


II.  CEREBRAL AQUEDUCT STENOSIS 
     A.  Congenital stenosis ofthe channel that drains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the 3rd 
          ventricle into the 4th ventricle 
     B.  Leads to accumulation of CSF in the ventricular space; most common cause of 
          hydrocephalus in newborns 
          1.  CSF is produced by the choroid plexus lining the ventricles. 
          2.  Flows from the lateral ventricles into the 3rd ventricle via the interventricular 
               foramen of Monro 
          3.  Flows from the 3rd ventricle into the 4th ventricle via the cerebral aqueduct 
          4.  Flows from the 4th ventricle into the subarachnoid space via the foramina of 
               Magendie and Luschka 
     C. Presents with enlarging head circumference due to dilation of the ventricles (cranial 
          suture lines are not fused) 


Ill. DANDY-WALKER MALFORMATION 
     A.  Congenital failure of the cerebellar vermis to develop 
     B.  Presents as a massively dilated 4th ventricle (posterior fossa) with an absent 
          cerebellum (Fig. 17.2); often accompanied by hydrocephalus

                                                                     involvement of the anterior white commissure of the spinothalamic tract with 
                                                                      sparing of the dorsal column (Table 17.1) 
                                                          D.  Syrinx expansion results in involvement of other spinal tracts leading to 
                                                                l.    Muscle atrophy and weakness with decreased muscle tone and impaired

           2.   Lateral corticospinal tract degeneration leads to upper motor neuron signs-
                 spastic paralysis with hyperreflexia, increased muscle tone, and positive Babinski 
                 sign. 
     B.  Atrophy  and weakness of hands is an early sign. 
           1.  Lack of sensory impairment distinguishes ALS from syringomyelia. 
     C.  Most cases are sporadic, arising in middle age adults. 
           1.   Zinc-copper superoxide dismutase mutation (SOD1) is present in some familial 
                 cases; leads to free radical injury in neurons 


V.  FRIEDREICH  ATAXIA 
     A.   Degenerative disorder of the cerebellum and spinal cord 
           1.   Degeneration of the cerebellum leads to ataxia. 
           2.   Degeneration of multiple spinal cord tracts leads to loss of vibratory sense and 
                 proprioception, muscle weakness in the lower extremities, and loss of deep 
                 tendon reflexes. 
     B.   Autosomal recessive; due to expansion of an unstable trinucleotide repeat (GAA) in 
           the frataxin gene 
           1.   Frataxin is essential for mitochondrial iron regulation; loss results in iron 
                 buildup with  free radical damage. 
     C.   Presents in early childhood; patients are wheelchair bound within a few years. 
     D.   Associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Inflammation  of the leptomeninges (Fig. 17.3) 
           1.   Meninges consist of three layers (dura, arachnoid, and pia) that lie between the 
                 brain and the skull. 
           2.   Pia and arachnoid together are termed leptomeninges.

                                        CEREBROVASCULAR       DISEASE 

I.   BASIC PRINCIPLES 
     A.   Neurologic deficit due to cerebrovascular compromise; major cause of morbidity and 
           mortality 
     B.   Due to ischemia (85% of cases) or hemorrhage (15% of cases) 
           1.   Neurons are dependent on serum glucose as an essential energy source and are 
                 particularly  susceptible to ischemia (undergo necrosis within 3- 5 minutes). 


II.  GLOBAL  CEREBRAL  ISCHEMIA 
     A.   Global ischemia to the brain 
     B.   Major etiologies 
           l.    Low perfusion (e.g., atherosclerosis) 
           2.   Acute decrease in blood flow (e.g., cardiogenic shock) 
           3.   Chronic hypoxia (e.g., anemia) 
           4.   Repeated episodes of hypoglycemia (e.g. , insulinoma) 
     C.  Clinical  features are based on duration and magnitude of the insult. 
           l.    Mild  global ischemia results in transient confusion with prompt recovery.

           2.   Severe global ischemia results in diffuse necrosis; survival leads to a 'vegetative 
                 state.' 
           3.   Moderate global ischemia leads to infarcts in watershed areas (e.g., area lying 
                 between regions fed by the anterior and middle cerebral artery) and damage to 
                 highly vulnerable regions such as 
                 i.    Pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex (layers 3, 5, and 6) - leads to 
                      laminar  necrosis 
                 ii.   Pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus (temporallobe)-important     in long-
                       term memory 
                 iii.  Purkinje  layer of the cerebellum-integrates sensory perception with motor 
                       control 


III. ISCHEMIC   STROKE 
     A.   Regional ischemia to the brain that results in focal neurologic deficits lasting > 24 
           hours 
           l.    If symptoms last < 24 hours, the event is termed a transient ischemic attack 
                 (TIA). 
     B.   Subtypes include thrombotic, embolic, and lacunar strokes. 
           l.    Thrombotic stroke is due to rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. 
                 i.    Atherosclerosis usually develops at branch points (e.g., bifurcation of internal 
                       carotid and middle cerebral artery in the circle of Willis). 
                 ii.   Results in a pale infarct at the periphery of the cortex (Fig. 17.4) 
           2.   Embolic stroke is due to thromboemboli. 
                 i.    Most common source of emboli is the left side of the heart (e.g., atrial 
                       fibrillation). 
                 ii.   Usually involves the middle cerebral artery 
                 iii.  Results in a hemorrhagic infarct at the periphery of the cortex 
           3.   Lacunar stroke occurs secondary to hyaline arteriolosclerosis, a complication of 
                 hypertension. 
                 i.    Most commonly involves lenticulostriate vessels, resulting in small cystic 
                       areas of infarction (Fig. 17.5) 
                 ii.   Involvement of the internal capsule leads to a pure motor stroke. 
                 iii.  Involvement of the thalamus leads to a pure sensory stroke. 
     C.   Ischemic stroke results in liquefactive necrosis. 
           l.    Eosinophilic change in the cytoplasm of neurons (red neurons, Fig. 17.6A) is an 
                 early microscopic finding (12 hours after infarction). 
           2.   Coagulative necrosis (24 hours), infiltration by neutrophils (days 1-3) and 
                 microglial  cells (days 4-7), and granulation tissue (weeks 2-3) then ensue. 
           3.   Results in formation of a fluid-filled  cystic space surrounded by gliosis (Fig. 
                 17.6B)

IV. INTRACEREBRAL   HEMORRHAGE 
     A.   Bleeding into brain parenchyma 
     B.   Classically due to rupture of Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysms of the 
           lenticulostriate vessels 
           1.   Complication of hypertension; treatment of hypertension reduces incidence by 
                 half. 
           2.   Basal ganglia is the most common site (Fig. 17.7). 
     C.   Presents as severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and eventual coma 


V.  SUBARACHNOID    HEMORRHAGE 
     A.   Bleeding into the subarachnoid space (Fig. 17.8) 
      B.  Presents as a sudden headache ("worst headache of my life") with nuchal rigidity 
      C.  Lumbar puncture shows xanthochromia (yellow hue due to bilirubin breakdown). 
      D.  Most frequently (85%) due to rupture of a berry aneurysm; other causes include AV 
           malformations  and an anticoagulated state. 
            l.   Berry aneurysms are thin-walled saccular outpouchings that lack a media layer 
                 (Fig. 17.9), increasing the risk for rupture. 
           2.   Most frequently located in the anterior circle of Willis  at branch points of the 
                 anterior communicating  artery 
           3.   Associated with Marfan syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney 
                 disease 



                                                              TRAUMA 

I.    EPIDURAL  HEMATOMA 
      A.  Collection of blood between the dura and the skull 
      B.  Classically due to fracture of the temporal bone with rupture of the middle 
           meningeal artery; bleeding separates the dura from the skull. 
            1.  Lens-shaped lesion on CT 
           2.   Lucid interval  may precede neurologic signs. 
      C.  Herniation  is a lethal complication. 


II.   SUBDURAL  HEMATOMA 
      A.  Collection of blood underneath the dura; blood covers the surface of the brain (Fig. 
            17.10). 
      B.  Due to tearing of bridging veins that lie between the dura and arachnoid; usually 
           arises with trauma 
            1.  Crescent-shaped lesion on CT 
           2.   Presents with progressive neurologic signs

           3.   Increased rate of occurrence in the elderly due to age-related cerebral atrophy, 
                 which stretches the veins 
     C.  Herniation  is a lethal complication. 


Ill.  HERNIATION 
     A.  Displacement of brain tissue due to mass effect or increased intracranial pressure 
     B.  Tonsillar  herniation involves displacement of the cerebellar tonsils into the foramen 
           magnum. 
           I.    Compression of the brain stem leads to cardiopulmonary arrest. 
     C.  Subfalcine herniation involves displacement of the cingulate gyrus under the falx 
           cerebri. 
           1.   Compression of the anterior cerebral artery leads to infarction. 
     D.  Uncal herniation  involves displacement of the temporal lobe uncus under the 
           tentorium cerebelli. 
           1.   Compression of cranial nerve III (oculomotor) leads to the eye moving "down 
                 and out" and a dilated pupil. 
           2.   Compression of posterior cerebral artery leads to infarction of occipital lobe 
                 (contralateral homonymous hemianopsia). 
           3.   Rupture of the paramedian artery leads to Duret (brainstem) hemorrhage. 



                                         DEMYELINATING      DISORDERS 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
      A.  Myelin insulates axons, improving the speed and efficiency of conduction. 
            1.  Oligodendrocytes myelinate the central nervous system. 
           2.   Schwann cells myelinate the peripheral nervous system. 
      B.  Demyelinating disorders are characterized by destruction of myelin or 
           oligodendrocytes; axons are generally preserved. 


II.   LEUKODYSTROPHIES 
      A.  Inherited mutations in enzymes necessary for production or maintenance of myelin 
      B.  Metachromatic leukodystrophy is due to a deficiency of aryl sulfatase (autosomal 
            recessive); most common leukodystrophy 
            1.  Myelin cannot be degraded and accumulates in the lysosomes of 
                 oligodendrocytes (lysosomal storage disease). 
      C.  Krabbe disease is due to a deficiency of galactocerebroside 
           (autosomal recessive). 
            1.  Galactocerebroside accumulates in macrophages. 
      D.  Adrenoleukodystrophy is due to impaired addition of coenzyme A to long-chain 
           fatty  acids (X-linked defect).

191
           1.   Accumulation of fatty acids damages adrenal glands and white matter of the 
                 brain. 


Ill.  MULTIPLE  SCLEROSIS 
     A.   Autoimmune destruction of CNS myelin and oligodendrocytes 
           1.   Most common chronic CNS disease of young adults (20-30 years of age); more 
                 commonly seen in women 
           2.   Associated with HLA-DR2 
           3.   More commonly seen in regions away from the equator 
     B.   Presents with relapsing neurologic deficits with periods of remission (multiple 
           lesions in time and space). Clinical features include 
           1.   Blurred vision in one eye (optic nerve) 
           2.   Vertigo and scanning speech mimicking alcohol intoxication (brainstem) 
           3.   Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (medial longitudinal  fasciculus) 
           4.   Hemiparesis or unilateral loss of sensation (cerebral white matter, usually 
                 periventricular) 
           5.   Lower extremity loss of sensation or weakness (spinal cord) 
           6.   Bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction (autonomic nervous system) 
     C.   Diagnosis is made by MRI and lumbar puncture. 
           1.   MRI  reveals plaques (areas of white matter demyelination). 
           2.   Lumbar puncture shows increased lymphocytes, increased immunoglobulins 
                 with oligoclonal IgG  bands on high resolution electrophoresis, and myelin basic 
                 protein. 
     D.   Gross examination shows gray-appearing plaques in the white matter (Fig. 17.11). 
      E.  Treatment of acute attacks includes high-dose steroids. 

            1.  Long-term treatment with  interferon beta slows progression of disease. 


IV. SUBACUTE  SCLEROSING PANENCEPHALITIS 
     A.   Progressive, debilitating encephalitis leading to death 
      B.  Due to slowly progressing, persistent infection of the brain by measles virus. 

            1.  Infection occurs in infancy;  neurologic signs arise years later (during childhood). 
      C.  Characterized by viral inclusions within neurons (gray matter) and 
           oligodendrocytes (white matter) 


V.  PROGRESSIVE MULTI  FOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY 
     A.   JC virus infection of oligodendrocytes (white matter) 

            1.  Immunosuppression (e.g., AIDS or leukemia) leads to reactivation of the latent 
                 virus. 
      B.  Presents with rapidly progressive neurologic signs (visual loss, weakness, dementia) 
           leading to death 


VI. CENTRAL  PONTINE   MYELINOLYSIS 
      A.  Focal demyelination of the pons (anterior brain stem) 
      B.  Due to rapid intravenous correction of hyponatremia 
           1.   Occurs in severely malnourished patients (e.g., alcoholics and patients with liver 
                 disease) 
      C.  Classically presents as acute b il ateral paralysis ("'ocked in" syndrome) 



                         DEMENTIA     AND   DEGENERATIVE      DISORDERS 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES 
      A.  Characterized by loss of neurons within the gray matter; often due to accumulation 
           of protein which  damages neurons 

192
     B.   Degeneration of the cortex leads to dementia. 
     C.  Degeneration of the brain stem and basal ganglia leads to movement disorders. 


II.  ALZHEIMER   DISEASE (AD) 
     A.   Degenerative disease of cortex; most common cause of dementia 
     B.   Clinical features 
           1.   Slow-onset memory loss (begins with short-term memory loss and progresses to 
                 long-term memory loss) and progressive disorientation 
           2.   Loss of learned motor skills and language 
           3.   Changes in behavior and personality 
           4.   Patients become mute and bedridden; infection is a common cause of death. 
           5.   Focal neurologic deficits are not seen in early disease. 
     C.   Most cases (95%) are sporadic and seen in the elderly. 
           I.    Risk increases with age (doubles every 5 years after the age of 60). 
           2.   E4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is associated with increased risk, t:2 allele 
                 with decreased risk. 
      D.  Early-onset AD is seen in 
           1.   Familial cases- associated with presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 mutations 
           2.   Down syndrome-commonly   occurs by 40 years of age 
      E.  Morphologic features include 
            1.  Cerebral atrophy with narrowing of the gyri, widening of the sulci, and dilation 
                 of the ventricles (Fig. 17.12A) 
           2.   Neuritic plaques-extracellular   core comprised of     amyloid with entangled 
                 neuritic processes (Fig. 17.12B) 
                 i.         amyloid is derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is coded 
                       on chromosome 21. APP normally undergoes alpha cleavage; beta cleavage 
                       results in AP amyloid. 
                 ii.   Amyloid  may also deposit around vessels, increasing the risk of hemorrhage. 
           3.   Neurofibrillary  tangles- intracellular  aggregates of fibers composed of 
                 hyperphosphorylated tau protein (Fig. 17.12C) 
                 i.    Tau is a microtubule-associated protein. 
           4.   Loss of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert 
      F.  Diagnosis is made by clinical and pathological correlation. 
            l.   Presumptive diagnosis is made clinically after excluding other causes. 
           2.   Confirmed by histology at autopsy (when possible) 


III.  VASCULAR DEMENTIA 
      A.  Multi focal infarction  and injury due to hypertension, atherosclerosis, or vasculitis 
      B.  2nd most common cause of dementia

                                                          A.  Degenerative disease of the frontal and temporal cortex; spares the parietal and 
                                                                occipital lobes 
                                                          B.  Characterized by round aggregates of tau protein (Pick bodies) in neurons of the 
                                                                cortex 
                                                          C.  Behavioral and language symptoms arise early; eventually progresses to dementia

                                                          B.   Common disorder related to aging; seen in 2% of older adults 
                                                          C.  Unknown  etiology; historically, rare cases were related to MPTP exposure (a 
                                                                contaminant  in illicit  drugs). 
                                                          D.  Clinical  features ('TRAP') 
                                                                1.   Tremor-pill    rolling  tremor at rest; disappears with movement 
                                                                2.   Rigidity-cogwheel   rigidity   in the extremities 
                                                                3.   Akinesia/bradykinesia- slowing   of voluntary movement; expressionless face

                                                          E.   Histology reveals loss of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra and round, 
                                                                eosinophilic inclusions of a-synuclein (Lewy bodies, Fig. 17.13C) in affected neurons. 
                                                           F.  Dementia is a common feature of late disease. 
                                                                1.   Early-onset dementia is suggestive of Lewy body dementia, which is

                                                           A.  Increased CSF resulting in dilated ventricles 
                                                           B.  Can cause dementia in adults; usually idiopathic

     C.  Presents as triad of urinary incontinence, gait instability, and dementia ("wet, 
           wobbly, and wacky") 
     D.  Lumbar puncture improves symptoms; treatment is ventriculoperitoneal shunting. 


VIII. SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY 
     A.   Degenerative disease due to prion protein 
           1.   Prion protein is normally expressed in CNS neurons in an a-helical 
                 configuration (PrP' ). 
     B.   Disease arises with conversion to a             conformation (PrP"). 
           1.   Conversion can be sporadic, inherited (familial forms of disease), or transmitted. 
     C.  Pathologic protein is not degradable and converts normal protein into the pathologic 
           form, resulting in a vicious cycle. 
           1.   Damage to neurons and glial cells is characterized by intracellular vacuoles 
                 (spongy degeneration, Fig. 17.15). 
     D.  Creutzfeldt-jakob disease (CJD) is the most common spongiform encephalopathy. 
           1.   Usually sporadic; rarely can arise due to exposure to prion-infected human 
                 tissue (e.g., human growth hormone or corneal transplant) 
           2.   Presents as rapidly progressive dementia associated with ataxia (cerebellar 
                 involvement) and startle myoclonus 
                 i.    Spike-wave complexes are seen on EEG. 
                 ii.   Results in death, usually in < 1 year 
           3.   Variant CJD is a special form of disease that is related to exposure to bovine 
                 spongiform encephalopathy ('mad cow'). 
     E.   Familial fatal insomnia is an inherited form of prion disease characterized by severe 
           insomnia and an exaggerated startle response. 



                                                         CNSTUMORS 

I.    BASIC PRINCIPLES

      B.  Metastatic tumors characteristically present as multiple, well-circumscribed lesions 
           at the gray-white junction. 
            1.  Lung, breast, and kidney are common sources. 
      C.  Primary tumors are classified according to cell type of origin (e.g., astrocytes, 
           meningothelial cells, ependymal cells, oligodendrocytes, or neuroectoderm). 
      D.  In adults, primary tumors are usually supratentorial. 
           1.   Most common tumors in adults are glioblastoma multiforme, meningioma, and 
                 schwannoma. 
      E.  In children, primary  tumors are usually infra tentorial.

     B.   Most common benign CNS tumor in adults 
           1.   More commonly seen in women; rare in children 
     C.   May present as seizures; tumor compresses, but does not invade, the cortex. 
     D.   Imaging reveals a round mass attached to the dura. 
     E.   Histology shows a whorled pattern (Fig. 17.17}; psammoma bodies may be present. 


IV. SCHWANNOMA 
     A.   Benign tumor ofSchwann cells 
      B.  Involves cranial or spinal nerves; within the cranium, most frequently involves 
           cranial nerve VIII  at the cerebellopontine angle (presents as loss of hearing and 
           tinnitus) 
      C.  Tumor cells are S-100 positive. 
      D.  Bilateral tumors are seen in neurofibromatosis type 2. 


V.  OLIGODENDROGLIOMA

196
     D.  Biopsy shows Rosenthal fibers (thick eosinophilic processes of astrocytes, Fig. 
           17.19B) and eosinophilic granular bodies; tumor cells are GFAP positive. 


VII. MEDULLOBLASTOMA 
     A.   Malignant tumor  derived from the granular cells of the cerebellum (neuroectoderm) 
     B.   Usually arises in children 
     C.  Histology  reveals small, round blue cells; Homer-Wright rosettes may be present. 
     D.  Poor prognosis; tumor grows rapidly and spreads via CSF. 
           I.    Metastasis to the cauda equina is termed 'drop metastasis.' 


VIII. EPENDYMOMA 
     A.   Malignant tumor  of ependymal cells; usually seen in children 
     B.   Most commonly arises in the 4th ventricle; may present with hydrocephalus

                                              SKELETAL SYSTEM 

I.   ACHONDROPLASIA 
     A. Impaired cartilage proliferation in the growth plate; common cause of dwarfism 
     B. Due to an activating mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3); 
          autosomal dominant 
          l.   Overexpression of FGFR3 inhibits growth. 
          2.  Most mutations are sporadic and related to increased paternal age. 
     C. Clinical features 
          l.   Short extremities with normal-sized head and chest-due to poor endochondral 
               bone formation; intramembranous bone formation is not affected. 
               i.   Endochondral bone formation is characterized by formation of a cartilage 
                    matrix, which is then replaced by bone; it is the mechanism by which long 
                    bones grow. 
               ii.   Intramembranous bone formation is characterized by formation of bone 
                    without a preexisting cartilage matrix; it is the mechanism by which flat 
                    bones (e .g., skull and rib cage) develop. 
     D. Mental function, life span, and fertility are not affected. 


II.  OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECT A 
     A.  Congenital defect of bone re sorption resulting in structurally weak bone 
     B.  Most commonly due to an autosomal dominant defect in collagen type I synthesis 
     C. Clinical features 
          l.   Multiple fractures of bone (can mimic child abuse, but bruising is absent) 
          2.  Blue sclera- Thinning of scleral collagen reveals underlying choroidal veins. 
          3.  Hearing loss-Bones of the middle ear easily fracture. 


III. OSTEOPETROSIS 
     A.  Inherited defect of bone resorption resulting in abnormally thick, heavy bone that 
          fractures easily 
     B.  Due to poor osteoclast function 
     C.  Multiple genetic variants exist; carbonic anhydrase II mutation leads to loss of the 
          acidic microenvironment required for bone resorption. 
     D.  Clinical features include 
          l.    Bone fractures 
          2.  Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia with extramedullary 
               hematopoiesis- due to bony replacement of the marrow (myelophthisic process, 
               Fig. 18.1) 
          3.  Vision and hearing impairment-due to impingement on cranial nerves 
          4.  Hydrocephalus-due to narrowing of the foramen magnum 
          5.  Renal tubular acidosis- seen with carbonic anhydrase II mutation 
               i.    Lack of carbonic anhydrase results in decreased tubular reabsorption of 
                    HCo,-, leading to metabolic acidosis. 
     E.  Treatment is bone marrow transplant; osteoclasts are derived from monocytes.

                                      FUNDAMENTALS     OF  PATHOLOGY 



IV. RICKETS/OSTEOMALACIA 
     A.   Defective mineralization of osteoid 
           1.   Osteoblasts normally produce osteoid, which is then mineralized with calcium 
                 and phosphate to form bone. 
     B.   Due to low levels of vitamin D, which results in low serum calcium and phosphate 
           1.   Vitamin  D is normally derived from the skin upon exposure to sunlight (85%) 
                 and from the diet (15%). 
           2.   Activation  requires 25-hydroxylation by the liver followed by 1-alpha-
                 hydroxylation by the proximal  tubule cells of the kidney. 
           3.   Active vitamin  D raises serum calcium and phosphate by acting on 
                 i.    Intestine- increases absorption of calcium and phosphate 
                 ii.   Kidney-increases  reabsorption of calcium and phosphate 
                 iii.  Bone-increases  resorption of calcium and phosphate 
           4.   Vitamin  D deficiency is seen with decreased sun exposure (e.g., northern 
                 latitudes), poor diet, malabsorption, liver failure, and renal failure. 
      C.  Rickets is due to low vitamin D in children, resulting in abnormal bone 
           mineralization. 
           1.   Most commonly arises in children < 1 year of age; presents with 
                 i.    Pigeon-breast deformity-inward   bending of the ribs with anterior 
                       protrusion of the sternum 
                 ii.   Frontal bossing (enlarged forehead)-due to osteoid deposition on the skull 
                 iii.  Rachitic rosary- due  to osteoid deposition at the costochondral junction 
                 iv.  Bowing of the legs may be seen in ambulating children. 
      D.  Osteomalacia is due to low vitamin D in adults. 
            1.  Inadequate mineralization results in weak bone with an increased risk for 
                 fracture. 
           2.   Laboratory findings include.!  serum calcium, ,J.. serum phosphate, t PTH, and t 
                 alkaline phosphatase. 


V.  OSTEOPOROSIS 
      A.  Reduction in trabecular bone mass 
      B.  Results in porous bone with an increased risk for fracture 
      C.  Risk of osteoporosis is based on peak bone mass (attained in early adulthood) and 
            rate of bone loss that follows thereafter. 
            1.  Peak bone mass is achieved by 30 years of age and is based on (1) genetics (e.g., 
                 vitamin  D receptor variants), (2) diet, and (3) exercise. 
           2.   Thereafter, slightly less than 1% of bone mass is lost each year; bone mass is lost 
                 more quickly with  lack of weight-bearing exercise (e.g., space travel), poor diet, 
                 or decreased estrogen (e.g., menopause). 
      D.  Most common forms of osteoporosis are senile and postmenopausal.

200
     E.  Clinical  features 
           I.    Bone pain and fractures in weight-bearing areas such as the vertebrae (leads to 
                 loss of height and kyphosis), hip, and distal radius 
           2.   Bone density is measured using a DEXA scan. 
           3.   Serum calcium, phosphate, PTH, and alkaline phosphatase are normal; labs help 
                 to exclude osteomalacia (which has a similar clinical presentation). 
     F.   Treatment includes 
           1.   Exercise, vitamin D, and calcium-limit   bone loss 
           2.   Bisphosphonates-induce apoptosis of osteoclasts 
           3.   Estrogen replacement therapy is debated (currently not recommended). 
           4.   Glucocorticoids are contraindicated (worsen osteoporosis). 


VI. PAGET DISEASE OF BONE 
     A.   Imbalance between osteoclast and osteoblast function 
           1.   Usually seen in late adulthood (average age> 60 years) 
     B.   Etiology is unknown; possibly viral 
     C.  Localized process involving one or more bones; does not involve the entire skeleton 
     D.  Three distinct stages are (l) osteoclastic, (2) mixed osteoblastic-osteoclastic, and (3) 
           osteoblastic. 
           1.   End result is thick, sclerotic bone that fractures easily. 
           2.   Biopsy reveals a mosaic pattern oflamellar bone (Fig. 18.2). 
     E.   Clinical features 
           1.   Bone pain- due to microfractures 
           2.   Increasing hat size - Skull is commonly affected. 
           3.   Hearing loss-impingement   on cranial nerve 
           4.   Lion-like facies - involvement of craniofacial bones 
           5.   Isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase-most common cause of isolated elevated 
                 alkaline phosphatase in patients> 40 years old 
      F.  Treatment includes 
           1.   Calcitonin-inhibits    osteoclast function 
           2.   Bisphosphonates-induces apoptosis of osteoclasts 
      G. Complications include 
            l.   High-output  cardiac failure-due   to formation of AV shunts in bone 
           2.   Osteosarcoma 


VII. OSTEOMYELITIS 
      A.  Infection of marrow  and bone 
            l.   Usually occurs in children 
      B.  Most commonly bacterial; arises via hematogenous spread 
           1.   Transient bacteremia (children) seeds metaphysis. 
           2.   Open-wound bacteremia (adults) seeds epiphysis. 
      C.  Causes include 
           1.   Staphylococcus aureus-most common cause (90% of cases) 
           2.   N gonorrhoeae-sexually  active young adults 
           3.   Salmonella-sickle  cell disease 
           4.   Pseudomonas-diabetics or IV  drug abusers 
           5.   Pasteurella- associated with cat or dog bite/scratches 
           6.   Mycobacterium tuberculosis- usually involves vertebrae (Pott disease) 
      D.  Clinical  features 
            l.   Bone pain with systemic signs of infection (e .g., fever and leukocytosis) 
           2.   Lytic focus (abscess) surrounded by sclerosis of bone on x-ray; lytic focus is 
                 called sequestrum, and sclerosis is called involucrum. 
      E.  Diagnosis is made by blood culture.

                                                          A.  Ischemic necrosis of bone and bone marrow 
                                                          B.  Causes include trauma or fracture (most common), steroids, sickle cell anemia, and 
                                                                caisson disease. 
                                                          C.  Osteoarthritis  and fracture are major complications.

                                                           A.  Benign tumor of osteoblasts (that produce osteoid) surrounded by a rim of reactive 
                                                                bone 
                                                           B.  Occurs in young adults < 25 years of age (more common in males)

           2.   Synovium lining  the joint capsule secretes fluid rich in hyaluronic acid to 
                 lubricate the joint and facilitate smooth motion. 


II.  DEGENERATIVE   JOINT  DISEASE (OSTEOARTHRITIS) 
     A.   Progressive degeneration of articular cartilage; most common type of arthritis 
     B.   Most often due to 'wear and tear' 
     C.   Major risk factor is age (common after 60 years); additional risk factors include 

           obesity and trauma. 
      D.  Affects a limited number of joints (oligoarticular);  hips, lower lumbar spine, knees, 
           and the distal interphalangeal joints (DIP) and proximal  interphalangeal joints (PIP) 
           of fingers are common sites. 
      E.  Classic presentation is joint stiffness in the morning that worsens during the day. 
      F.  Pathologic features include 
            l.   Disruption  of the cartilage that lines the articular surface (Fig. 18.7); fragments 
                 of cartilage floating in  the joint space are called 'joint mice.' 
           2.   Eburnation  of the subchondral bone 
           3.   Osteophyte formation (reactive bony outgrowths); classically arises in the DIP 
                 (Heberden nodes) and PIP (Bouchard nodes) joints of the fingers 


III.  RHEUMATOID    ARTHRITIS 
      A.  Chronic, systemic autoimmune disease

      B.  Characterized by involvement of joints 
            l.    Hallmark  is synovitis leading to formation of a pannus (inflamed granulation 
                 tissue). 
            2.  Leads to destruction of cartilage and ankylosis (fusion) of the joint 
      C.  Clinical  features 
            l.    Arthritis  with  morning stiffness that improves with activity. 
                 i.    Symmetric involvement of PIP joints of the fingers (swan-neck deformity), 
                       wrists (ulnar  deviation), elbows, ankles, and knees is characteristic (Fig. 
                       18.8); DIP is usually spared (unlike osteoarthritis). 
                 ii.    Joint-space narrowing, loss of cartilage, and osteopenia are seen on x-ray. 
            2.  Fever, malaise, weight loss, and myalgias

           1.   IgM autoantibody against Fe portion ofigG  (rheumatoid factor); marker of 
                 tissue damage and disease activity 
           2.   Neutrophils and high protein  in synovial fluid 
     E.   Complications include anemia of chronic disease and secondary amyloidosis.

           2.   Presents with low back pain; involvement of vertebral bodies eventually arises, 
                 leading to fusion of the vertebrae ('bamboo spine'). 
           3.   Extra-articular  manifestations include uveitis and aortitis (leading  to aortic 
                 regurgitation).

     D.   Psoriatic arthritis is seen in 10% of cases of psoriasis. 
            1.  Involves axial and peripheral joints; DIP joints of the hands and feet are most 
                 commonly affected, leading to "sausage" fingers or toes. 


V.  INFECTIOUS   ARTHRITIS 
      A.  Arthritis   due to an infectious agent, usually bacterial 
      B.  Causes include 
            1.  N gonorrhoeae-young  adults; most common cause 
           2.   S au reus-older children  and adults; 2nd most common cause 
      C.  Classically involves a single joint, usually the knee 
      D.  Presents as a warm joint with limited range of motion; fever, increased white count, 
           and elevated ESR are often present. 


VI. GOUT 
      A.  Deposition of monosodium  urate (MSU) crystals in tissues, especially the joints 
      B.  Due to hyperuricemia; related to overproduction or decreased excretion of uric acid

           3.   Renal insufficiency-decreased  renal excretion of uric acid 
      E.  Presents as exquisitely painful arthritis of the great toe (podagra) 
            1.  MSU crystals deposit in the joint, triggering  an acute inflammatory reaction. 
            2.  Alcohol  or consumption of meat may precipitate arthritis. 
      F.  Chronic  gout leads to 
            1.  Development of tophi-white,    chalky aggregates of uric acid crystals with 
                 fibrosis and giant cell reaction in the soft tissue and joints (Fig. 18.9A) 
            2.  Renal failure-Urate   crystals may deposit in kidney tubules (urate nephropathy). 

205
     G.  Laboratory findings include hyperuricemia; synovial fluid  shows needle-shaped 
           crystals with negative birefringence under polarized light (Fig. 18.9B). 
     H.  Pseudo gout resembles gout clinically, but is due to deposition of calcium 
           pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD); synovial fluid shows rhomboid-shaped crystals 
           with weakly positive birefringence under polarized light. 



                                                   SKELETAL    MUSCLE 

I.   DERMATOMYOSITIS 
     A.   Inflammatory  disorder of the skin and skeletal muscle 
      B.  Unknown etiology; some cases are associated with carcinoma (e.g., gastric 
           carcinoma). 
     C.   Clinical features 
           1.   Bilateral proximal muscle weakness; distal involvement can develop late in 
                 disease.

III.  X-LINKED  MUSCULAR   DYSTROPHY 
      A.  Degenerative disorder characterized by muscle wasting and replacement of skeletal 
           muscle by adipose tissue 
      B.  Due to mutations of dystrophin 
            1.  Dystrophin  is important for  anchoring the muscle cytoskeleton to the 
                 extracellular matrix. 
           2.   Mutations are often spontaneous; large gene size predisposes to high rate of 
                 mutation. 
      C.  Duchenne muscular dystrophy is due to deletion of dystrophin. 
            1.  Presents as proximal muscle weakness at 1 year of age; progresses to involve 
                 distal m us des 
                 i.    Calf pseudohypertrophy is a characteristic finding. 
                 ii.   Serum creatinine kinase is elevated. 
            2.  Death results from cardiac or respiratory failure; myocardium is commonly 
                 involved. 
      D.  Becker muscular dystrophy is due to mutated dystrophin; clinically results in milder 
            disease

           2.  Symptoms improve with anticholinesterase agents. 
           3.  Associated with thymic hyperplasia or thymoma; thymectomy improves 
                symptoms. 


II.  LAMBERT-EATON   SYNDROME 
     A.  Antibodies  against presynaptic calcium channels of the neuromuscular junction 
     B.   Arises as a paraneoplastic syndrome, most commonly due to small cell carcinoma of 
           the lung 
     C.  Leads to impaired acetylcholine release 
           1.   Firing of presynaptic calcium channels is required for acetylcholine release. 
     D.  Clinical  features 
           1.   Proximal muscle weakness that improves with use; eyes are usually spared. 
           2.   Anticholinesterase agents do not improve symptoms. 
           3.   Resolves with resection of the cancer

                                                INTRODUCTION 

I.   SKIN 
     A. Functions as a barrier against environmental insults and fluid loss 
     B. Composed of an epidermis and dermis 
     C. Epidermis is comprised ofkeratinocytes and has four layers (Fig. 19.1). 
          I.   Stratum basalis- regenerative (stem cell) layer 
          2.  Stratum spinosum-characterized by desmosomes between keratinocytes 
          3.  Stratum granulosum- characterized by granules in keratinocytes 
          4.  Stratum corneum- characterized by keratin in anucleate cells 
     D. Dermis consists of connective tissue, nerve endings, blood and lymphatic vessels, 
          and adnexal structures (e.g. , hair shafts, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands). 


                                  INFLAMMATORY    DERMATOSES 

I.   ATOPIC (ECZEMATOUS) DERMATITIS 
     A.  Pruritic, erythematous, oozing rash with vesicles and edema; often involves the face 
          and flexor surfaces 
     B. Type I hypersensitivity reaction; associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis 


II.  CONTACT DERMATITIS 
     A.  Pruritic, erythematous, oozing rash with vesicles and edema 
     B.  Arises upon exposure to allergens such as 
          1.  Poison ivy and nickel jewelry (type IV hypersensitivity) 
          2.  Irritant chemicals (e.g. , detergents) 
          3.  Drugs (e.g ., penicillin) 
     C. Treatment involves removal of the offending agent and topical glucocorticoids, if 
          needed. 


III. ACNE VULGARIS 
     A.  Comedones (whiteheads and blackheads), pustules (pimples), and nodules; 
          extremely common, especially in adolescents 
     B.  Due to chronic inflammation of hair follicles and associated sebaceous glands 
          I.   Hormone-associated increase in sebum production (sebaceous glands have 
               androgen receptors) and excess keratin production block follicles, forming 
               comedones. 
          2.  Propionibacterium acnes infection produces lipases that break down sebum, 
               releasing proinflammatory fatty acids; results in pustule or nodule formation 
     C. Treatment includes benzoyl peroxide (antimicrobial) and vitamin A derivatives (e.g. , 
          isotretinoin), which reduce keratin production. 


IV. PSORIASIS 
     A.  Well-circumscribed, salmon-colored plaques with silvery scale, usually on extensor 
          surfaces and the scalp (Fig. 19.2A); pitting of nails may also be present. 
     B.  Due to excessive keratinocyte proliferation

                                                                exposure to sunlight, albinism, and xeroderma pigmentosum; an additional risk 
                                                                factor is dysplastic nevus syndrome (autosomal dominant disorder characterized by 
                                                                formation  of dysplastic nevi that may progress to melanoma). 
                                                          C.   Presents as a mole-like growth with "ABCD" (Fig. 19.13)

           1.  Asymmetry 
           2.  Borders are irregular. 
           3.  Color  is not uniform. 
           4.  Diameter>   6 mm 
     D.  Characterized by two growth phases 
           1.  Radial growth  horizontally  along the epidermis and superficial dermis; low risk 
                of metastasis 
           2.   Vertical growth into  the deep dermis 
                 i.    Increased risk of metastasis; depth of extension (Breslow thickness) is the 
                      most important  prognostic factor in predicting  metastasis. 
     E.  Variants include 
           1.   Superficial spreading-most  common subtype; dominant early radial growth 
                 results in good prognosis. 
           2.   Lentigo maligna melanoma-lentiginous   proliferation  (radial growth); good 
                 prognosis 
           3.   Nodular- early  vertical  growth; poor prognosis 
           4.   Acrallentiginous- arises   on the palms or soles, often in dark-skinned 
                 individuals; not related to UV light  exposure 



                                              INFECTIOUS     DISORDERS 

I.   IMPETIGO 
     A.   Superficial bacterial skin infection, most often due to S aureus or S pyogenes 
     B.   Commonly affects children 
     C.  Presents as erythematous macules that progress to pustules, usually on the face; 
           rupture of  pustules results in erosions and dry, crusted, honey-colored serum. 


II.  CELLULITIS 
     A.   Deeper (dermal and subcutaneous) infection, usually due to S au reus or S pyogenes 
     B.   Presents as a red, tender, swollen rash with fever 
     C.   Risk factors include recent surgery, trauma, or insect bite. 
     D.   Can progress to necrotizing fasciitis with necrosis of subcutaneous tissues due to 
           infection  with anaerobic 'flesh-eating' bacteria 
           l.    Production of CO, leads to crepitus. 
           2.   Surgical emergency 


III. STAPHYLOCOCCAL    SCALDED  SKIN SYNDROME 
     A.   Sloughing of skin with erythematous rash and fever; leads to significant skin loss 
     B.   Due to S aureus infection; exfoliative A and B toxins result in epidermolysis of the 
           stratum granulosum.

     C.  Distinguished  histologically from toxic epidermal necrolysis by level of skin 
           separation; separation in TEN occurs at the dermal-epidermal junction. 


IV. VERRUCA  (WART) 
     A.   Flesh-colored papules with a rough surface (Fig. 19.14) 
     B.   Due to HPV infection of keratinocytes; characterized by koilocytic change 
     C.   Hands and feet are common locations. 


V.  MOLLUSCUM  CONTAGIOSUM 
     A.   Firm, pink, umbilicated  papules due to poxvirus; affected keratinocytes show 
           cytoplasmic inclusions (molluscum bodies, Fig. 19.15) 
     B.   Most often arise in children; also occur in sexually active adults and 
           immunocompromised  individuals
