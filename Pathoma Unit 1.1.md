 

GROWTH ADAPTATIONS
L BASIC PRINCIPLES

B. “ increase, non or with in stress on an organ can result in growth

adaptations.

IL HYPERPLASIA AND HYPERTROPHY
A. An increase in stress leads to an increase in organ size.
1 Occurs via an increase in the size (hypertrophy) and/or the number

(hyperplasia) ofcells cytoskeleton t

B. Hypertrophy involves gene activation, protein synthesis, and production of
organelles.

C. Hyperplasia involves the production ofnew cells from stem cells.

1 Permanent tissues (e.g. however,
cannot make new cells and undergo hypertrophy only.
2 For example, cardiac myocytes undergo hypertrophy, not hyperplasia, in

 

response to systemic hypertension (Fig. 1.1).

 

E. Pathologic hyperplasia (e.g., endometrial hyperplasia) can progress to dysplasia and,
eventually, cancer.

 

1 A notable exception is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which does not
increase the risk for prostate cancer.

 

 

 

Ill. ATROPHY
A. A decrease in stress (e.g., decreased hormonal stimulation, disuse, or decreased
nutrients/blood supply) leads to a decrease in organ size (atrophy).

B. Decrease in cell number occurs via apoptosis.
C. Decrease in cll siz occurs va ubiquitin: proteosome degradation ofthe
cytoskeleton and autophagy of cellular components.

1 Occurs via a

1 In ubiquitin-proteosome degradation, intermediate filaments ofthe cytoskeleton
are "tagged" with ubiquitin and destroyed by proteosomes.

2 Autophagy ofcellular components involves generation of autophagic vacuoles.
These vacuoles fuse with lysosomes whose hydrolytic enzymes breakdown
cellular components.

IV. METAPLASIA
A.
1 Most commonly involves change of one type of surface epithelium (squamous,
columnar, or urothelial) to another
2 Metaplastic cells are better able to handle the new stress.
B. Barrett esophagus is a classic example.

For example: Heart

It has a function of pumping
against the Systemic BP & it is in
homeostasis when it deals with that
physiologic stress.

If the organ has to do more work,
it will become bigger in order to do
the excess work. It may occur via
hypertrophy or hyperplasia.

A cell has a skeleton k/a
cytoskeleton & it is what gives the
cell its size & its shape. If we want
the cell to get bigger, we are going
to have to increase the production
of cytoskeleton & it is primarily
made up of proteins.

Hypo means less hyperplasia) or metaplasia (e.g., Barrett esophagus)

D. Dysplasia is reversible, in theory, with alleviation ofinciting stress.

1 Ifstress persists, dysplasia progresses to carcinoma (irreversible).

VI APLASIA AND HYPOPLASIA
A. Aplasia is failure ofcell production during embryogenesis (¢.g., unilateral renal
agenesis).
B. Hypoplasia is a decrease in cell production during embryogenesis, resulting in a
relatively small organ (eg,, streak ovary in Turner syndrome).

Mesenchymal Tissues

- Bone, blood vessels, cartilage & fats are mesenchymal in origin (also called connective
tissue)

 

Myositis Ossificans

- In Myositis Ossificans, inflammation of the skeletal muscle results in a metaplastic
production of bone in the skeletal muscle, it is usually after a trauma when the skeletal
muscle is healing.
- This is not be confused with osteosarcoma, which can be ruled out by

a. The bone adjacent is normal

b. Distinct separation between bony metaplasia with the bone

 

*note it is separated from the
bone-its in the muscle (it is not
an osteosarcoma)

 

What musculoskeletal disorder is characterized by metaplasia of skeletal muscle to bone?
- Myositis ossificans

- The non-hereditary form (myositis ossificans traumatica) is due to trauma to muscle causing bone
to form

(fupe 1 receptor) causing endothelial cells to transform to mesenchymal cells and then to bone
 

Figures 17-88 and 17-89 Myositis ossificans, MRI and bone scan

The rounded lesion (4) of the upper arm adjacent to the humerus in the T1-weighted MR image in the /eft pane? is a tumorlike mass
within skeletal muscle called myositis ossificans. It is a benign form of connective tissue metaplasia that results from a florid healing
response to injury. In the right panel, the lesion appears as a discrete “hot spot” in soft tissue in a bone scan.

Atrophy

1. Atrophy via decrease in cell size may occur via autophagy of cellular components

This process is mediated by the Beclin-1 core complex; which helps generate autophagic vacuoles that consume cellular organelles, these
combine with lysozymes whose hydrolytic enzymes break down organelles for nutrients

Autophagy is a response to a State of cellular starvation, this is recognized by Akt and results in inhibition of mTOR, relieving inhibition of
autophagy
