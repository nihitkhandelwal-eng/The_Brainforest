- Title: How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking – for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers
- Authors: Ahrens, Sönke

- **Highlights and Notes**
   ## Cover
    - "One cannot think without writing.“
   ## Introduction
    - Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note.  (p: 1)
    - process of writing starts much, much earlier than that blank screen and that the actual writing down of the argument is the smallest part of its development.  (p: 2)
    - Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work. And maybe that is the reason why we rarely think about this writing, the everyday writing, the note - taking and draft - making.  (p: 2)
    - We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly. But without an immediate experience of failure, there is also not much demand for help. And the publishing market working how it works, there is not much help in supply for this lack of demand either. It is the panic in front of the blank screen that brings students and academic writers to turn to the bookshelves full of self - help books on writing, a market publishers meet in droves by focusing on how to deal with this horse - has - already - left - the - barn situation.  (p: 2)
    - Most people struggle for much more mundane reasons, and one is the myth of the blank page itself. They struggle because they believe, as they are made to believe, that writing starts with a blank page. If you believe that you have indeed nothing at hand to fill it, you have a very good reason to panic.  (p: 3)
    - Just having it all in your head is not enough, as getting it down on paper is the hard bit.  (p: 3)
    - That is why good, productive writing is based on good note - taking.  (p: 3)
    - The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic.  (p: 3)
    - single most important indicator of academic success is not to be found in people’s heads, but in the way they do their everyday work.  (p: 4)
    - there is no measurable correlation between a high IQ and academic success – at least not north of 120. Yes, a certain intellectual capacity helps to get into academia, and if you struggle severely with an IQ test, it is likely that you will struggle to solve academic problems, too. But once you are in, a superior IQ will neither help you to distinguish yourself nor protect you from failure.  (p: 4)
    - bad news is that we do not have this kind of control over ourselves. Self - discipline or self - control is not that easy to achieve with willpower alone.  (p: 4)
    - Willpower is, as far as we know today, [ 2 ] a limited resource that depletes quickly and is also not that much up for improvement over the long term( Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, and Tice, 1998; Muraven, Tice, and Baumeister, 1998; Schmeichel, Vohs, and Baumeister, 2003; Moller, 2006).  (p: 4)
    - self - control and self - discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves( cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2) – and the environment can be changed. Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn’t one around. And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway.  (p: 5)
    - Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well - defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long - and short - term interests. Having a meaningful and well - defined task beats willpower every time.  (p: 5)
    - Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success.  (p: 5)
   ## 1 Everything You Need to Know
    - A good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important : The content, the argument and the ideas.  (p: 5)
    - Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something.  (p: 6)
    - If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible.  (p: 6)
    - To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower. This is not only demotivating, but also unsuitable for an open - ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight,  (p: 6)
    - How do you plan for insight, which, by definition, cannot be anticipated ?  (p: 6)
    - The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward.  (p: 6)
    - We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery – or insight.  (p: 6)
