### The Age of the Linked Note
Note taking is not a new thing, but with the improvement in technology...
A note can now grow and evolve with other notes to form a living system.

Nick mentions that this transformation came because of convergence of 4 distinct elements
1. Fast Notes
2. Free Notes
3. Atomic Notes
4. Linked Notes

In knowledge terms this is the beginning of a new age, "The Age of the Linked Note"
