Contrast with [[The Rise of the Note Maker]]
### The Age of the Linked Note
Note taking is not a new thing, but with the improvement in technology...
A note can now grow and evolve with other notes to form a living system of related thoughts that you can nurture throughout lifetime.

Nick mentions that this transformation came because of convergence of 4 distinct elements
1. Fast Notes 
	- Evernote was the first one to do so
2. Free Notes
3. Atomic Notes
	- This was proposed by [[Andy Matuschak]]
4. Linked Notes

In knowledge terms this is the beginning of a new age, "The Age of the Linked Note"

But a basic question to answer before we think about "how?", [[I Want To Make Notes Because|Why is it that I want to take notes?]]


### We Fixated On Collecting Junk
Collecting can be addictive. It can give us the illusion that we are making progress. This is the Collector's Fallacy.

To me, it always felt that "one day I'll come back to all the things I am collecting & then I'll be a genius", I am still not sure of how to process the information overload.
I have about 1400 emails snoozed to the end of year & I am hoping to read through them at a rate of 5/day but it just keeps on piling up.
