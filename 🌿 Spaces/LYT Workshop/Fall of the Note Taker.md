### We Fixated On Collecting Junk
Collecting can be addictive. It can give us the illusion that we are making progress. This is the Collector's Fallacy.

To me, it always felt that "one day I'll come back to all the things I am collecting & then I'll be a genius", I am still not sure of how to process the information overload.
I have about 1400 emails snoozed to the end of year & I am hoping to read through them at a rate of 5/day but it just keeps on piling up.
