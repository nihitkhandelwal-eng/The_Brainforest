- As babies, our sense of the world was without edges, there was no "you" or "I". 
  Everything was everywhere, all at once.
- Overtime, we noticed that there was "us" & "something around us"
	- There was an Inhale & an Exhale.
	- We had an Encounter & we made an Expression
	- So, our world grew

- So we encountered something, thought about it & then expressed ourselves.
- But we cannot stop everytime to think about every little thing, so we developed **habits**, intuition. 
- But good habits can go bad, if we are not acting intuitively, instinctivally but reactively, then this world of ours shrinks

- We can then lose our agency & become vulnerable to the talking points of other people. So how do we get that back?
