> Research is using Critical Thinking for Knowledge Creation

![[Screenshot 2022-06-25 at 18.59.18.png|500]]

Researchers are always swimming in a sea of uncertainity. So the job is to create new knowledge which means make sense of previous knowledge, information coming from experiments, observations & we neeed to be able to make arguments.

We are looking to complete a puzzle, but we don't know what we are looking for, so we need to look for possible pieces & see if they fit to create a puzzle.

We also need to give structure but here is the catch, a perfectionist researcher will end up saying "I want to learn how to take notes in the proper way before I start". This is exactly who I am right now. But like Nick Milo said this on multiple occasions...    ![[The Folder Rebellion#^63632b]]

### Introduction to Agile Note Making
The Waterfall Method → This idea says that you only go to the next step when you have completely finished the first step. So all the other steps will die of starvation because you didn't move the flow of water into the other steps.
This is a [[Perfectionist Mindset]]

**The Agile Method** → This proposes creating drops of ideas & you work with what you have & then we move that along the pipeline towards the research output. You keep doing it until a point that it can become a good waterfall.

We break [[Perfectionist Mindset|Perfectionism]] by trying to do something very quickly, howsoever bad it is at the moment & then re-iterate & improve over that, this is really aligned with [[Idea Emergence]]


### Research Encounters
When do I encounter *my own thoughts?*
- Reading papers
- Analyzing the result of an experiment
- While talking to research participants
- While collaborating
- In shower
- On the toilet
- LYT discussions
- When something doesn't make sense
- With Aanya
- While explaining something to someone
