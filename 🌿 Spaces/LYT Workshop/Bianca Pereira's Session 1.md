> Research is using Critical Thinking for Knowledge Creation

![[Screenshot 2022-06-25 at 18.59.18.png|500]]

Researchers are always swimming in a sea of uncertainity. So the job is to create new knowledge which means make sense of previous knowledge, information coming from experiments, observations & we neeed to be able to make arguments.

We are looking to complete a puzzle, but we don't know what we are looking for, so we need to look for possible pieces & see if they fit to create a puzzle.

We also need to give structure but here is the catch, a perfectionist researcher will end up saying "I want to learn how to take notes in the proper way before I start". This is exactly who I am right now. But like Nick Milo said this on multiple occasions...    ![[The Folder Rebellion#^63632b]]

### Introduction to Agile Note Making
The Waterfall Method → This idea says that you only go to the next step when you have completely finished the first step. So all the other steps will die of starvation because you didn't move the flow of water into the other steps.
This is a [[Perfectionist Mindset]]

**The Agile Method** → This proposes creating drops of ideas & you work with what you have & then we move that along the pipeline towards the research output. You keep doing it until a point that it can become a good waterfall.

We break [[Perfectionist Mindset|Perfectionism]] by trying to do something very quickly, howsoever bad it is at the moment & then re-iterate & improve over that, this is really aligned with [[Idea Emergence]]


### Research Encounters
When do I encounter *my own thoughts?*
- Reading papers
- Analyzing the result of an experiment
- While talking to research participants
- While collaborating
- In shower
- On the toilet
- LYT discussions
- When something doesn't make sense
- With Aanya
- While explaining something to someone



### What is Agile Note Making

![[Screenshot 2022-06-25 at 19.50.47.png|700]]

1. It is Exploratory
	- There is no one right way, you need to explore them on your own.
	- **Let Ideas Be Born** as you encounter them. (eg: in the shower.
2. It is Iterative
	- We improve ideas on a *sprint*
	- Take notes first & then think of improving them.
	- Maybe choose a few ideas to improve every week.
3. It is Practical
	- **You need to define what is good enough** for a specific amount of time that you have.
	- Our research needs to be high quality but it needs to be done in the first place.


## The PKM Pyramid

### PKM Mindsets
1. Follow the flow
	- Free writing  ^82c9fc
		- Write whatever comes to mind (Let your thoughts guide you). 
		- Can't erase. Can't stop writing.
	- Sometimes there is nothing coming out of free writing but the idea is to keep doing it & let seredipity work it's way.
		- We really need to embrace the idea of atomic notes so that ![[#^febd99]]
			- While trying to [[#^0d0743|extract ideas from a document]] there will be moments where you will be like, "Ahh Well, I don't care about that" & some of them are "Well, I do want to explore them more later, so I want them to have their own notes"
	- Using the app [Squibler](https://www.squibler.io/dangerous-writing-prompt-app)
		- ![[25-Jun-22#The Most Dangerous Writing App|I wrote for 10 minutes]]
2. Write Ideas, not Documents ^0d0743
	- The problem is that our ideas are trapped in a very complex argument. 
	- It's hard to break down
	- The solution is to create [[Atomic Notes]]
		- **ONE IDEA PER NOTE**
		- Atomic Notes free up ideas
		- This helps us to create multiple arguments from one note
		- One idea can be a part of multiple papers, presentations. ^febd99
		- Go through your [[#^82c9fc|Free Writing]] & select paragraphs/ideas & use the note refactor to create a new note.

### Soup of Notes
- No folders, no tags, no structure
- Only ad links if they come "naturally"
- Focus on creating [[Atomic Notes]]
- Notice when you are "struggling"
