- These are non-rigid, highly flexible organizing structures that you can use as needed.
- They are mostly referring to the [[Higher Order Notes]] like MOC's & the Home Note.

Nick describes fluid frameworks as: (in the context of MOC) 
1.  **Non-destructive**: The notes that are linked within are not affected.
2.  **Non-exclusive**: MOCs don’t limit discoverability
3.  **Non-limiting**: You can create countless variations of structure.
4.  **Co-existing**: MOCs don’t impede other MOCs.
5.  **Heterarchial**: There is no hard-coded, rigid top-down structure.
6.  **Overlapping**: MOCs can link to the same notes, no big deal.
7.  **Augment-able**: MOCs can quickly augment the view of your library.
8.  **Neighborly**: MOCs stay out of the way, unless you need them.
9.  **Delete-able**: You can delete MOCs and your notes remain unaltered (unlike folders).
    -   You’ve lost _value_ but you haven’t lost core _information_.
10.  **Fluid**: Like water, MOCs can form to the changing shape of your needs.


> Fluid frameworks are a non-essential supporting structures. Whereas, a typical framework, like a folder, is an essential supporting structure. If that folder is deleted, so is the content within it. That's not the case with fluid frameworks


| Note organization                | Phase metaphor | Character |
| -------------------------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| folders                          | solid          | rigid     |
| higher-order links (MOCs)        | liquid         | fluid     |
| first-order links (Zettelkasten) | gas            | chaotic   |

Fluid frameworks are notable to me because they occupy the creative space in the range of organizational choices for notes — on the boundary between order and chaos.
