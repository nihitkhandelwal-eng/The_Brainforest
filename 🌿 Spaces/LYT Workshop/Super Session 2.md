### Placeholder Notes
When you build a cognitive scaffolding for yourself so that your ideas can accrete/accumulate/grow.
Cognitive scaffolding doesn't just support active thinking it supports future thinking.

Notes are *seeds* that you plant so you can cultivate them in the future.
Notes *"discrete" and "orbit"* around a topic growing in mass and gravity.
Nords are thrown into *"slow burns"* until there is enough fuel for a fire. we can use placeholder tags

There are two basic ways to allow ideas to accrete
1. Create placeholder notes and link to them.
2. Create placeholder tags & use the tag.
