### Placeholder Notes
When you build a cognitive scaffolding for yourself so that your ideas can accrete/accumulate/grow.
Cognitive scaffolding doesn't just support active thinking it supports future thinking.

Notes are *seeds* that you plant so you can cultivate them in the future.
Notes *"discrete" and "orbit"* around a topic growing in mass and gravity.
Nords are thrown into *"slow burns"* until there is enough fuel for a fire. we can use placeholder tags

There are two basic ways to allow ideas to accrete
1. Create placeholder notes and link to them.
2. Create placeholder tags & use the tag.

Do we have a place where we can go & find a lot of ideas that resonate with them, that they could link out to for future version of themselves & create placeholder notes from?
It is [[My Spark List|The Spark List]]. So, I'll be looking at [[My Spark List#Key concepts I keep coming back to|Key concepts I keep coming back to]].


### Knowledge Management
We can collect things & we can create things. We should spend time doing both. However in the [[Age of information abundance]] we spend too much time collecting & there is only so much time to spend.

The purpose of this workshop is to push back & to achieve a healthier balance. This may not be 50-50. You might be in a new field & it grows into collecting again, but some other time creating phase starts to grow again.

But this is how most people are, majority in consuming > collecting > creating

We can use the [[ENCODE Framework]] to create a balance between the 3 phases

We have been in this habit of pushing around other people's information

### The LYT Framework
![[Screenshot 2022-06-26 at 16.20.37.png|700]]

- In [[Idea Emergence#Emergence Level 1|Emergence Level 1]] we go from nothingness into somethingness because we capture an idea.
- In [[Idea Emergence#Emergence Level 2|Emergence Level 2]] we have a bunch of notes & we start connecting them to each other.
- But we get to a point where, we want to see the forest but all we can see is the trees. In [[Idea Emergence#Emergence Level 3|Emergence Level 3]] we put some of the notes into a higher order note to assemble them & start working with them with time. 
	- We now have created a [[Thought Collisions|Thought Collider]] 
- From that work it is very easy to have a final creation, that project, essay, book, screenplay, poem, argument, whatever that might be. But on top of that, you have also given yourself a map to navigate through which will continue to live long after the project/essay is done & submitted.
	- This final creation might collide with something else & create something entirely new months, years, decades from now.
- All this goes to the [[üè° Home|Home Note]]

If we throw [[ENCODE Framework]] on top of [[Idea Emergence]] we can clearly see that we encounter things, take notes to form a primordial soup & then CODE becomes a process.

CODE is where linear part of the process goes away, it's a non linear process, a symphony.

### The 7 C's of Note Making

### Sense Making
It is us trying to make sense of the world
It is something that we cannot escape from, it is us being the fish, swimming in water. It's what we do.
### Note Making
It is an intentional version of [[#Sense Making]]
#### Some prompts for Note Making
- What does this remind me of?
- What is this similar to, and different from? 
- When have I experienced this thing in my life?


### Wu wei
A concept literally meaning "inexertionm, inaction or effortless action". Alan watts called Wu wei not forcing. It is the art of sailing, rather than the art of rowing.

- What does this remind me of?
	- Using the already existing resources to move forwards without having to spend yours unnecessarily
	- It is also reminding me of the puppets at Times Now saying the names of chinese solidiers
	- Making something look ridiculously simple
		- Ronnie O'Sullivan
- What is this similar to, and different from? 
	- It is not being passive or lazy
	- 
- When have I experienced this thing in my life?
