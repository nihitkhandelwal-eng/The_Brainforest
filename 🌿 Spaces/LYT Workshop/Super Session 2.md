### Placeholder Notes
When you build a cognitive scaffolding for yourself so that your ideas can accrete/accumulate/grow.
Cognitive scaffolding doesn't just support active thinking it supports future thinking.

Notes are *seeds* that you plant so you can cultivate them in the future.
Notes *"discrete" and "orbit"* around a topic growing in mass and gravity.
Nords are thrown into *"slow burns"* until there is enough fuel for a fire. we can use placeholder tags

There are two basic ways to allow ideas to accrete
1. Create placeholder notes and link to them.
2. Create placeholder tags & use the tag.

Do we have a place where we can go & find a lot of ideas that resonate with them, that they could link out to for future version of themselves & create placeholder notes from?
It is [[My Spark List|The Spark List]]. So, I'll be looking at [[My Spark List#Key concepts I keep coming back to|Key concepts I keep coming back to]].


### Knowledge Management
We can collect things & we can create things. We should spend time doing both. However in the [[Age of information abundance]] we spend too much time collecting & there is only so much time to spend.

The purpose of this workshop is to push back & to achieve a healthier balance. This may not be 50-50. You might be in a new field & it grows into collecting again, but some other time creating phase starts to grow again.

But this is how most people are, majority in consuming > collecting > creating

We can use the [[ENCODE Framework]] to create a balance between the 3 phases
