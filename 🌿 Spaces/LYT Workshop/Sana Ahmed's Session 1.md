### What is your goal for creating content or having a brand?
- I want to share what I love with others who I love as well
- Get my name out there.
- I want to make money doing this.
- It brings me accountability & better understanding of the things I write & think.


In this session we will cover the following topics of PKM for Content Creation and Branding:
### Main Law of Brand Building
- It is to serve, serve you & your audience
### Authenticity - How do you want to stand out?
What are you selling, is it your personality, your ideas, your stories, coaching, digital products?

What is your biggest barrier to branding yourself?
- I don't think I have anything unique to sell
- It sometimes feels manipulative

**Authenticity is your unique edge**
- How do you find your unique edge?
	- It is based on [[The Sensemaking Loop]]

Auhenticity is a daily practice, it's not easy to do if you are not in the habit of doing it.
I personally don't feel that way, because for the majority of who I am, it is transparent to everyone, I donâ€™t act around.
But it can be difficult for people who haven't done it for years.

### Encountering YOU for Idea Emergence
Encountering yourself as a means to uncovering who you are is a great way to begin, even if you feel that you are authentic.

Revisit & develop on the notes from [[Super Session 1]] & connect them to tell the stories from here that you can tell to your audience that will make them want to connect with you. 
These were not polished notes, I took them really quickly ..... [[My Unique Journey#^58302d|In The Beginning]]  |  [[My Unique Journey#^9ece07|I Went On A Journey]] |  [[My Unique Journey#^a15e04|I Met People & Did Things]]
 |  [[My Unique Journey#^09a0c9|I Grew & Developed Skills]]  |  [[My Unique Journey#^10bf43|And Now]]

All of this represents your story & it is a very authentic place that you are coming from
