We have this tendency to classify everything in a folder, be it in our analog system or in the computers.

Thinking in terms of systems, folders are can be classified as **rigid, linear & top-down**

The Zettlekasten method provided an alternative but in doing so, it completely abolished folders & as rigid as they are, we crave structure. ^6fec1c

If we throw away the dogma surrounding the Zettelkasten method i.e. strict atomic notes. Perhaps, folders can be helpful & not only this, but [[higher order notes]] that give us the structure we crave. ^74a4f2

But, instead of using rigid folder only structures, we have the ability to use flexible fluid frameworks.

### Folders have their benefits
If you always think with “folders first”…
-   You will discourage your ability to think connectively.
-   You will spend more time asking, “Where exactly should I put this note?”
-   You will stunt the long-term growth of a complex and interesting digital library.

A “folders first” approach encourages rigid thinking.

> If **folders** can stop hogging all the attention and make room for **links** and **tags**, they can form an unbeatable trio…the best trio since Harry, Ron, and Hermione…the most balanced trio since rock, paper, scissors.

- Abolishing folders completely is an over-correction, a knee-jerk reaction, a rebellion against the parents of our digital upbringing.
- There are many ways to use folders, but the best way to add new ones is to allow their need to emerge slowly through using your system.

> Structure has to be earned!

If you find yourself thinking more than once that, “a folder would be perfect here,” then that’s your cue to try one out, and see if it can earn a long-term role.
