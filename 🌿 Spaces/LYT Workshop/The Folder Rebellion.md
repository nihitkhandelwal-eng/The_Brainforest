We have this tendency to classify everything in a folder, be it in our analog system or in the computers.

Thinking in terms of systems, folders are can be classified as **rigid, linear & top-down**

The Zettlekasten method provided an alternative but in doing so, it completely abolished folders & as rigid as they are, we crave structure. ^6fec1c

If we throw away the dogma surrounding the Zettelkasten method i.e. strict atomic notes. Perhaps, folders can be helpful & not only this, but [[higher order notes]] that give us the structure we crave. ^74a4f2

But, instead of using rigid folder only structures, we have the ability to use flexible fluid frameworks.


### Folders have their benefits
If you always think with “folders first”…
-   You will discourage your ability to think connectively.
-   You will spend more time asking, “Where exactly should I put this note?”
-   You will stunt the long-term growth of a complex and interesting digital library.

A “folders first” approach encourages rigid thinking.
