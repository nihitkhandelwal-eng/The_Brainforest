We have this tendency to classify everything in a folder, be it in our analog system or in the computers.

Thinking in terms of systems, folders are can be classified as **rigid, linear & top-down**

The Zettlekasten method provided an alternative but in doing so, it completely abolished folders & as rigid as they are, we crave structure.

If we throw away the dogma surrounding the Zettelkasten method i.e. strict atomic notes. Perhaps, folders can be helpful & not only this, but [[higher order notes]] that give us the structure we crave.

But, instead of using rigid folder only structures, we have the ability to use flexible fluid frameworks.
