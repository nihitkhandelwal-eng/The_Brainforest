## My Unique Perspective
> Your evolution from birth to now
 Quick Note: Be kind to yourself...

### In the Beginning
- Where were you born?
	- I was born in Sikar at Dr Rajkumari Bhargav's Place
- Where did you grow up?
	- Sikar
- What was your first memory?
	- First memory would be dressing up as "a madrasi" in a fancy dress in school
- What was your family dynamic?
	- It was very pleasant, both my parents are & were very supportive. Nothing dramatic.
- Where did you go to high school? How was your experience? Who were your friends?
	- Sikar & partially in Jaipur
	- It was kind of a dramatic experience, I was never without a girlfriend during my grade 6th-10th
	- Sharad & Atul were my good friends.
	- In NMS, I had good friendship with Avi Jain
- Are you still friends with any of them? Why or Why not?
	- Not in touch with Atul since class 10th
	- I talk to sharad once or twice a year but nothing like friends, more like acquaintances
	- Not in touch with Avi since I left NMS
	- I haven't been proactive in maintaining my friendships, so I think it is mostly on me.
- How did you rebel?
	- I was a [[Session 1#^aa3ae0|very angry kid]] as I have described in my first therapy session 
	- I also asked a lot of questions as an act of rebellion


### I went on a journey
- Where did you go to college? What did you choose to study? 
	- I went to Jodhpur, it was not in my hand, I got a rank based on which I got the college.
	- I chose to study medicine because I think I was very much biased by my surroundings & the success that my parents enjoyed, they worked very hard for it but to me then, it was not something that I thought of.
- Where have you lived?
	- Sikar, Jaipur, Jodhpur & Gurgaon
- How did each place shaped you?
	- Sikar made me kind of reserved & not wanting to go out at all
	- Jaipur exposed me to the real world
	- Jodhpur is something I am not sure about, I don't think I learnt anything of value there
	- Gurgaon is shaping me to be more like actual me, because I donâ€™t have to worry about anyone here. 


### I Met People & Did things?
- What notable group or activities were you part of?
	- Part of Co-x3 these days. 
	- Very much into the PKM space
- What teachers/role models made an impact on you?
	- I regret the way I lived through my school days & the teachers were not bad, we were not very good students
- What were your impactful experiences?
	- I can mostly think of negative impactful experience.
		- Relationships went wrong

### I grew & developed skills
- What skills did you develop?
	- I am a very good teacher, I think.
	- I have a really good sense of humor
	- I have a good sense of music
	- I am really good at talking people into rational things.
- What values did you pick up?  
	- I am an honest person, will not betray.
	- I am a very genuine person
- **How many pivots have you had?**
	- **I have had 1 pivotal point in my life & I am really happy about it.**
	- It's weird to say this now, but these days I am glad that it happened.
- What interests did you have since a young age?
	- Really interested in technology
	- Science
	- Psychology


### And Now...
- Living in gurgaon, with Mami & the kids, sitting on a wonderful chair which Mama brought because I am apparently a prince with high needs.
