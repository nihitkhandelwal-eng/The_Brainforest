### What a Blast

We started with the [[Overview of PKM]] to then learn about the [[ENCODE Framework]] & [[The Sensemaking Loop]] which then connects to [[My Unique Journey]] & [[My Spark List]].

> My Unique Journey + My Spark List = My Unique Perspective


### Seamless Integration
It's hard to see why a journaling like exercise was included in the session but on my 2nd visit to the recording, it's just so seamlessly integrated.
