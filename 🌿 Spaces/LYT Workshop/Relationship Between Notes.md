**Notes are people**. That means:
-   **Links** are strong relationships, like family or good friends or even colleagues.
	- Direct links are the strongest type of relationship.
	- They are the purest and most explicit way of connecting two notes.
	- This is the core method of growing a healthy, dynamic zettelkasten.
	- Links force you to focus on “relevance”. **Links encourage lateral thinking** and the *generation of unexpected insights.*
	- But links have their limitation ![[Idea Emergence#^808174]]
-   **Tags** are weak relationships, like people who like the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
-   **MOCs** are people who have assembled together for some reason (an event, party, etc).
-   **Proximity** are people on the same flight—you might be with family, or friends, or your team—but you might also be with a total group of strangers too.
