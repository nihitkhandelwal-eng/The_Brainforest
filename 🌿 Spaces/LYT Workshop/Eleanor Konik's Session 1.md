> [!question] What is your priority?
> Getting information into your notes easily or getting it back out again?
> Are you a person who gets things out very easily, note taking is simple for you. 
> 
> Is it getting information out of your head & formulate it i.e. **IDEATION?** OR
> Finding the notes is challenging for you i.e **MEMORY/REDISCOVERY?**

### Background Sparks Connections
1. What do you already know?
2. What do you wonder? What do you want to know?
3. What did you learn?
4. Did you learn what you were wondering about?
5. Did you learn anything related to what you wanted to learn?
6. Did you learn anything related to what you already knew?
7. Take Note!



- Take one of the things you encountered recently and consider: Why was this something you followed up on? How does it relate to what you already knew & wondered about?
- Now make a note, phrased as a claim. Complete the sentence: "I learned that..."
- Do it again, and try to figure out: how can I relate these two ideas? Force it a little, just to get in a repetition. 


#### The story
I came up with the concept of imaginary friends for aanya, like baby panda, baby horsey, baby buffalo & baby puppy. This was all organic, I did not plan about doing it. I give her horsey rides, so horsey was born inside E-004. I created baby buffalo, because that seemed funny. Baby puppy was born because I want her not to be afraid of dogs & puppies, so giving her a pet might help.

Baby panda was born out of sheer boredom, she was getting bored in the car ride from gurgaon to chandigarh & to make things interesting, I created the cutest thing I could imagine. 

##### I wonder
- Kids of what age let go of such things, Vihaan is 11 & he participates in the conversation about baby panda but it is mostly for fun & for his sister.
- What goes on in a kids mind when all of this is happening?
- Does this i


##### Analogies
I have been thinking about this panda concept a lot. A bunch of analogies & references came to mind while doing that.
1. Vihaan reminded me of the invisible friends episode from boss baby. That was an AHA moment. I didn't realize how much of a genius I was, I absolutely did not have any inspiration from boss baby. I came up with my own idea to do wonders for a kid.
2. Giving her baby panda has it's psychological perks
	- She now talks about her vulnerabilities in the name of baby panda. Yesterday, she was saying some "no-no words", possibly based on her past experiences she has this habit of saying "I don't remember", at any time she is confronted.
		- This time she did not, I asked her that "I heard baby panda say this & that, where do you think he learnt that?". She pointed out a popular song & said, that maybe he heard it from here.
	- She is more confident in playing by herself.
	- She is developing more care giving attitude towards animals, particularly insects.
		- We took her to a national park/zoo last week, it was her first visit. She read the signs which said "ENDANGERED" "VULNERABLE" & had a query about them, which me & my brother addressed.
		- So, now she has another query about baby panda, "is he endangered?" she asked. I said, "not right now, but they are vulnerable".
		- Then we got into the whole lesson about why pandas are vulnerable & at one time were endangered.
		- So, she understands the concept that, because humans are expanding, the natural habitats are reducing for animals & insects.
		- Everytime she is scared of an ant, she says "Hey baby ant, it's okay, this was your home once, but can you please go outside in the grass?"
		- 
3. She sleeps better
4. While we were on the trip, we went to Shimla, the main attraction there is shopping & food. Aanya does not like shopping & has limited non-spicy taste in food, so I was trying to figure out how can I keep her calm & entertained, so that others can enjoy. Here came baby panda to rescue.
	- I felt that if she had a purpose walking on the shopping street, she might not get bored & will actually enjoy the process. So, I told her that baby panda ran away to a tree.
	- Couple of things about baby panda
		- He loves bamboo & he cannot differentiate between a bamboo tree & a normal tree.
		- He speak the language bamboo, i.e. anything he doesn't know is bamboo to him. He is 4 months old & is learning new words every day.
		- He loves eating, resting & dancing.
		- Loves to climb on trees.
	- Now, because the shopping place had 3 levels of roads & so, baby panda climbed on the tallest tree i.e. on 3rd level & all throughout the shopping marathon, while everyone was shopping, Aanya was looking for signs of baby panda. 
	- It was raining, very cold, a walk of more than 4 kilometers but the smile & happiness after finding baby panda after 5 hours was something I am so proud of.
	- I had to put baby panda on a bamboo tree on a rainy day for 5 hours so that everyone can have a good time including aanya.
5. I talked to Anne about it. I wanted to know if I was doing too much of this imaginary friend thing. She said "as long as she knows how to put the baby animals aside & has a sense of boundary, it's alright". She also mentioned that, kids know that it is not real, but because it gives them a secure feeling in a world that can get overwhleming, they subconsciously hang on to it.
	- She also mentioned a movie called "Harvey" (1950s), which I have added to my watchlist.
6. If you are religious & are not comfortable with criticism/jokes about religion, please don't read ahead
	- Out of 7 billion people in this world, a big majority is religious, they all have imaginary friends till they die. Some of them have multiple friends. Almost all of them get offended by anything critical of their friend & yet they laugh when a 4-6 year old kid does that. How pathetic!




##### Similar thoughts
This reminds me of the pets thing in gamification system that conrad designed & also religion.

I learned that if kids are exposed to anything in a good story format, they can not only learn from that but derive a good sense of entertainment from something most adults find silly. They are basically moulds & if given the right direction, the results can be
