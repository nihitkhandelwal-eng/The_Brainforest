> [!question] What is your priority?
> Getting information into your notes easily or getting it back out again?
> Are you a person who gets things out very easily, note taking is simple for you. 
> 
> Is it getting information out of your head & formulate it i.e. **IDEATION?** OR
> Finding the notes is challenging for you i.e **MEMORY/REDISCOVERY?**

### Background Sparks Connections
1. What do you already know?
2. What do you wonder? What do you want to know?
3. What did you learn?
4. Did you learn what you were wondering about?
5. Did you learn anything related to what you wanted to learn?
6. Did you learn anything related to what you already knew?
7. Take Note!



- Take one of the things you encountered recently and consider: Why was this something you followed up on? How does it related to what you already knew & wondered about?
- Now make a note, phrased as a claim. Complete the sentence: "I learned that..."
- Do it again, and try to figure out: how can I relate these two ideas? Force it a little, just to get in a repetition. 


I came up with the concept of imaginary friends for aanya, like baby panda, baby horsey, baby buffalo & baby puppy. This was all organic, I did not plan about doing it. I give her horsey rides, so horsey was born inside E-004. I created baby buffalo, because that seemed funny. Baby puppy was born because I want her not to be afraid of dogs & puppies, so giving her a pet might help.

Baby panda was born out of sheer boredom, she was getting bored in the car ride from gurgaon to chandigarh & to make things interesting, I created the cutest thing I could imagine. 

I have been thinking about this panda concept a lot. A bunch of analogies & references came to mind while doing that.
1. Vihaan reminded me of the invisible friends episode from boss baby. That was an AHA moment. I didn't realize how much of a genius I was, I absolutely did not have any inspiration from boss baby. I came up with my own idea to do wonders for a kid.
2. Giving her baby panda has it's psychological perks
	- She now talks about her vulnerabilities in the name of baby panda. Yesterday, she was saying some "no-no words", possibly based on her past experiences she has this habit of saying "I don't remember", at any time she is confronted.
		- This time she did not, I asked her that "I heard baby panda say this & that, where do you think he learnt that?". She pointed out a popular song & said, that maybe he heard it from here.
	- She is more confident in playing by herself.
	- She is developing more care giving attitude towards animals, particularly insects.
		- We took her to a national park/zoo last week, it was her first visit. She read the signs which said "ENDANGERED" "VULNERABLE" & had a query about them, which me & my brother addressed.
		- So, now she has another query about baby panda, "is he endangered?" she asked. I said, "not right now, but they are vulnerable".
		- Then we got into the whole lesson about why pandas are vulnerable & at one time were endangered.
		- So, she understands the concept that, because humans are expanding, the natural habitats are reducing for animals & insects.
		- Everytime she is scared of an ant, she says "Hey baby ant, it's okay, this was your home once, but can you please go outside in the grass?"
		- 
3. She sleeps better
4. I talked to Anne about it. 

This reminds me of the pets thing in gamification system that conrad designed.
