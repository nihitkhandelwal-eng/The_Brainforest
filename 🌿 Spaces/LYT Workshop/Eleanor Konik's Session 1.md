> [!question] What is your priority?
> Getting information into your notes easily or getting it back out again?
> Are you a person who gets things out very easily, note taking is simple for you. 
> 
> Is it getting information out of your head & formulate it i.e. **IDEATION?** OR
> Finding the notes is challenging for you i.e **MEMORY/REDISCOVERY?**

### Background Sparks Connections
1. What do you already know?
2. What do you wonder? What do you want to know?
3. What did you learn?
4. Did you learn what you were wondering about?
5. Did you learn anything related to what you wanted to learn?
6. Did you learn anything related to what you already knew?
7. Take Note!


- Take one of the things you encountered recently and consider: Why was this something you followed up on? How does it relate to what you already knew & wondered about?
- Now make a note, phrased as a claim. Complete the sentence: "I learned that..."
- Do it again, and try to figure out: how can I relate these two ideas? Force it a little, just to get in a repetition. 

I wrote quite a good note on  [[The Rise of Baby Panda]]


### How to Ignite the spark?
If you want to get better at igniting the spark, the exercises will help.

> One I like to do as an exercise is look at the objects in my room, then state two facts: “I have 10 matching green pens next to my desk.” “My desk has two monitors.”
> \- Eleanor Konik

After all, it’s not just a laptop in a dusty room, I have matching pens instead of just a random collection of whatever pens I picked up from events, so perhaps I bought them on purpose, which means I prioritize having that specific pen, which probably means I care about writing in a way that the average person doesn’t… Generally having two monitors instead of just one is associated with computer “power users” but since I have all those pens, I’m probably not a computer programmer or video editor… I’m probably a writer.
