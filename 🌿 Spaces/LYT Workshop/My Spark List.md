Guidelines for writing it.
1. 1. Use sparks to light a fire in your mind. 
2. Then start with the subtitles, ususually starting with "How".
3. Some subtitle "How" prompts:
	- How NOUN is GOOD & how to VERB it.
	- How to VERB SOMETHING because of BENEFITS
		- eg: how to use metaphors more often because they are both more fun & more powerful

- Objectivity is the one tool you need
- Why do you need to be rational
- How to be rational because it is rational to be so.
- How do kids think & how to talk to them
- I respect you too much to not tell you the truth
