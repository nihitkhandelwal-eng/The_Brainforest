	- In NMS, I had good friendship with Avi Jain
- Are you still friends with any of them? Why or Why not?
	- Not in touch with Atul since class 10th
	- I talk to sharad once or twice a year but nothing like friends, more like acquaintances
	- Not in touch with Avi since I left NMS

### I went on a journey
^9ece07

- Where did you go to college? What did you choose to study? 
	- I went to Jodhpur, it was not in my hand, I got a rank based on which I got the college.
	- I chose to study medicine because I think I was very much biased by my surroundings & the success that my parents enjoyed, they worked very hard for it but to me then, it was not something that I thought of.
- Where have you lived?
	- Sikar, Jaipur, Jodhpur & Gurgaon
- How did each place shaped you?
	- Sikar made me kind of reserved & not wanting to go out at all
	- Jaipur exposed me to the real world
	- Jodhpur is something I am not sure about, I don't think I learnt anything of value there
	- Gurgaon is shaping me to be more like actual me, because I donâ€™t have to worry about anyone here.
