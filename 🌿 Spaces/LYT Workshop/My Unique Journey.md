### In the Beginning
^58302d

- Where were you born?
	- I was born in Sikar (1998) at Dr Rajkumari Bhargav's place.
- Where did you grow up?
	- Sikar
- What was your first memory?
	- First memory would be dressing up as "a madrasi" in a fancy dress in school.
	- I remember moma putting some powder on my head.
- What was your family dynamic?
	- It was very pleasant, both my parents are & were very supportive. Nothing dramatic.
- Where did you go to high school? How was your experience? Who were your friends?
	- Sikar & partially in Jaipur.
	- It was kind of a dramatic experience, I was never without a girlfriend during my grade 6th-10th.
	- Sharad & Atul were my good friends.
	- In NMS, I had good friendship with Avi Jain, Varnit Trivedi, Shagun Gupta, Nitin Jain. 
- Are you still friends with any of them? Why or Why not?
	- Not in touch with Atul since class 10th
	- I talk to sharad once or twice a year but nothing like friends, more like acquaintances
	- Not in touch with Avi since I left NMS, have talked to Varnit a couple of times but not since the past few years, met Shagun in sikar a few years ago, haven't talked to Nitin, maybe I was thinking about him today i.e. [[06-Jul-22]] because of [[Baby Panda]] 
	- I haven't been proactive in maintaining my friendships, so I think it is mostly on me.
- How did you rebel?
	- I was a [[Session 1#^aa3ae0|very angry kid]] as I have described in my first therapy session 
	- I also asked a lot of questions as an act of rebellion


### I went on a journey
^9ece07

- Where did you go to college? What did you choose to study? 
	- I went to Jodhpur, it was not in my hand, I got a rank based on which I got the college.
	- I chose to study medicine because I think I was very much biased by my surroundings & the success that my parents enjoyed, they worked very hard for it but to me then, it was not something that I thought of.
- Where have you lived?
	- Sikar, Jaipur, Jodhpur & Gurgaon
- How did each place shaped you?
	- Sikar made me kind of reserved & not wanting to go out at all
	- Jaipur exposed me to the real world
	- Jodhpur is something I am not sure about, I don't think I learnt anything of value there.
		- This is obviously not true, will write more about this at some point.
	- Gurgaon is shaping me to be more like actual me, because I donâ€™t have to worry about anyone here. 


### I Met People & Did things?
^a15e04

- What notable group or activities were you part of?
	- Part of Co-x3 these days. 
	- Very much into the PKM space.
- What teachers/role models made an impact on you?
	- I regret the way I lived through my school days & the teachers were not bad, we were not very good students.
	- I fondly remember Supreeti Ma'am from NMS, she was very supportive of me, I was a spoilt kid, now that I think of it.
- What were your impactful experiences?
	- I can mostly think of negative impactful experience.
		- Relationships went wrong
	- Again, not obviously true, but if held at a few second thing, this is what I come back to every time.
