Note taking is not a new thing, but with the improvement in technology...
A note can now grow and evolve with other notes to form a living system of related thoughts that you can nurture throughout lifetime.

Nick mentions that this transformation came because of convergence of 4 distinct elements
1. Fast Notes 
	- Evernote was the first one to do so
2. Free Notes
3. Atomic Notes
	- This was proposed by [[Andy Matuschak]]
4. Linked Notes

Notes should be able to live in multiple places at once, just like how we think, where many things are triggering the same idea. 
Folders tend to be restricting here. 

> In knowledge terms this is the beginning of a new age, "The Age of the Linked Note"

But a basic question to answer before we think about "how?", [[I Want To Make Notes Because|Why is it that I want to take notes?]]
