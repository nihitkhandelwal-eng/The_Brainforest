Guided Session in Creative Writing

- Write down a book, a film or a tv show you recently watched or read that's making you think these days.
	- Better Call Saul
- Write "what are some *free associations* you have from those texts" 
	- Prompts
		- Does the main character remind you of someone?
		- What theme is the text exploring?
		- What similar texts have you read in the past?
		- How are your life experiences similar and how are they different?
		- Why is this the text that's prompt your mind?
	- I really like the character of Mike Ehrmantraut
	- It is a mixture of breaking bad & breaking good
	- Breaking Bad is the closest thing that comes to mind.
	- I don't have any similar life experiences.
	- Nick Milo was assistant editor for the show & also it is currently in it's final season with the second half supposed to release on [[12-07-22|July 12th]]


### Problem Statement & Cure
There are 2 types of would-be writers:
- Those that think everything they write is *worthless*
- Those that think everything they write is *priceless*

The cure would be 
- Learn to ignore that voice especially while writing the first draft because then you kill the flame.
- This voice is not useless, it's not useful while you are writing your first draft, it's helpful while revising it.


### Three Pillars of Writing
3 pillars of writing on which the creative writing as an art form stands.

#### Writing
Not just when you have a solid inspiration

When you're really inspired you might create something beautiful but if you don't prepare for those moments when that amazing inspiration hits you're not going to be prepared for it.

So the first pillar is writing itself. That means that you need to write a lot not just when the inspiration hits, you need to write daily. If you don't do it how are you going to get better at the craft?


#### Reading
You need to read what you're writing, otherwise how are you going to get out of those cliches, those ideas that everyone has *as a first idea*

The term reading here is not just for reading books or texts, it's basically everything around you. Even going to the beach is "reading" if you are conscious about it & if you write something about it.

If you are in writing films, you shouldn't just watch movies, you should read screenplays.


#### Feedback
You need a wall to bounce your ideas from. So that you can rework your ideas based on the feedback you get.

Feedback is not validation for what you write or what you don't write it is not a process that you go through after you've finished writing it's a process that you do while you're writing it.


### Sturgeon's Law
Sturgeon's law (or Sturgeon's revelation) is an adage stating "**ninety percent of everything is crap**". The adage was coined byÂ Theodore Sturgeon, an American science fiction author and critic.

So, by extension 90% of your life is crap?

It's okay for me to write horrible stuff because I am just exercising my writing muscles.
