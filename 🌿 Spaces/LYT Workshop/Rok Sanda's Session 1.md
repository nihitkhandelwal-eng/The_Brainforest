Guided Session in Creative Writing

- Write down a book, a film or a tv show you recently watched or read that's making you think these days.
	- Better Call Saul
- Write "what are some *free associations* you have from those texts" 
	- Prompts
		- Does the main character remind you of someone?
		- What theme is the text exploring?
		- What similar texts have you read in the past?
		- How are your life experiences similar and how are they different?
		- Why is this the text that's prompt your mind?
	- I really like the character of Mike Ehrmantraut
	- It is a mixture of breaking bad & breaking good
	- Breaking Bad is the closest thing that comes to mind.
	- I don't have any similar life experiences.
	- Nick Milo was assistant editor for the show & also it is currently in it's final season with the second half supposed to release on [[12-07-22|July 12th]]
