Nick says that the intention is to give a concept handle to that crucial point we seem to all be experiencing more with "information anxiety/overwhlem".

Those moments when you feel like writing on something, coming to a conclusion about something, agreeing to something, rebelling against something, but realize that you cannot figure out what you actually feel about "something". 

### Copied from Nick's Notes
#status/ðŸ’­think 
AÂ **Mental Squeeze Point**Â is when your unsorted knowledge becomes so messy it overwhelms and discourages you. Either you are equipped with frameworks to overcome the squeeze point, or you are discouraged and possibly abandon your project. This is usually followed by yet another search for the next shiny distraction that will make all the difference.

The Mental Squeeze Point is an emotion. Itâ€™s something you feel, whether or not youâ€™re consciously aware of it. Try to be. Try to be aware of when you feel discouraged, or overwhelmed, or disappointed with yourself, or unhappy with your efforts. Itâ€™s possible thatâ€™s the form that the mental squeeze point has taken.

Perhaps the best way to overcome these squeeze points are to create a new safe space to assemble and organize the knowledge youâ€™re currently working onâ€”before it completely overwhelms you. One dedicated space for thinking we can use is an MOC (Map of Content).
