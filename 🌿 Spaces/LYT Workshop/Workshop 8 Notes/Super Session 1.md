### What a Blast
It's important to learn how to manage & learn how to swim in the ocean of information, if not, things might get harder & eventually this is what makes people become mindless & they eventually end up saying, "why think so much?"

Much like, if a new boxer does not learn the techniques & improves themselves, eventually they are not going to be interested in boxing, because they are not good at it. Unfortunately information & knowledge is not one thing, it is who we are.

We started with the [[Overview of PKM]] to then learn about the [[ENCODE Framework]] & [[The Sensemaking Loop]] which then connects to [[My Unique Journey]] & [[My Spark List]]. Lastly he introduced [[Idea Emergence]]

> My Unique Journey + My Spark List = My Unique Perspective


### Seamless Integration
It's hard to see why a journaling like exercise was included in the session but on my 2nd visit to the recording, it's just so seamlessly integrated.
