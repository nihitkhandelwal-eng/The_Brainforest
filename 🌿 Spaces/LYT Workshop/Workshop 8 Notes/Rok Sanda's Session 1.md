Guided Session in Creative Writing

- Write down a book, a film or a tv show you recently watched or read that's making you think these days.
	- Better Call Saul
- Write "what are some *free associations* you have from those texts" 
	- Prompts
		- Does the main character remind you of someone?
		- What theme is the text exploring?
		- What similar texts have you read in the past?
		- How are your life experiences similar and how are they different?
		- Why is this the text that's prompt your mind?
	- I really like the character of Mike Ehrmantraut
	- It is a mixture of breaking bad & breaking good
	- Breaking Bad is the closest thing that comes to mind.
	- I don't have any similar life experiences.
	- Nick Milo was assistant editor for the show & also it is currently in it's final season with the second half supposed to release on [[12-07-22|July 12th]]


### Problem Statement & Cure
There are 2 types of would-be writers:
- Those that think everything they write is *worthless*
- Those that think everything they write is *priceless*

The cure would be 
- Learn to ignore that voice especially while writing the first draft because then you kill the flame.
- This voice is not useless, it's not useful while you are writing your first draft, it's helpful while revising it.


### Three Pillars of Writing
![[RokSandaSession1.jpg|700]]
3 pillars of writing on which the creative writing as an art form stands.

#### Writing
Not just when you have a solid inspiration

When you're really inspired you might create something beautiful but if you don't prepare for those moments when that amazing inspiration hits you're not going to be prepared for it.

So the first pillar is writing itself. That means that you need to write a lot not just when the inspiration hits, you need to write daily. If you don't do it how are you going to get better at the craft?


#### Reading
You need to read what you're writing, otherwise how are you going to get out of those cliches, those ideas that everyone has *as a first idea*

The term reading here is not just for reading books or texts, it's basically everything around you. Even going to the beach is "reading" if you are conscious about it & if you write something about it.

If you are in writing films, you shouldn't just watch movies, you should read screenplays.


#### Feedback
You need a wall to bounce your ideas from. So that you can rework your ideas based on the feedback you get.

Feedback is not validation for what you write or what you don't write it is not a process that you go through after you've finished writing it's a process that you do while you're writing it.

See [[Sturgeon's Law]] for more.

### Snowflake
You indeed are a special snowflake. This relates back to [[My Unique Journey]]

## Exercise
### Exercise 1
Make a list of films, tv shows, books etc... that inspire you
	It needs to contain a story
	The list should contain at least 10 items
	the order of the list is not important

- Better Call Saul
- Breaking Bad
- How to Take Smart Notes
- PK
- The Martian
- Sherlock Holmes
- The Office
- Why I Am An Atheist
- The God Delusion
- Aaonga Na Jaaonga
- Daniels Sloss's Jigsaw

### Exercise 2
Select three of those pieces of art that make your heart and/or mind the most excited 
write it out in a sentence for each text 
	9 words maximum for each 
	don't think too much you don't have enough time for that

- Better Call Saul
	- Jimmy McGill to Saul Goodman, Darker Shades Emerge
- The Martian
	- Man alone on Mars. Solitude is beautiful.
- The Office
	- An American Workplace & Hilarious Staff With Eccentricities. 


### Exercise 3
Select of of them
	maybe the one for which the sentence came easiest
	write the structure of the text 
		maximum 5 lines of five words in each line

- The Martian
	- Futuristic times, a team goes to Mars.
	- One man get's left, supposed dead
	- He survives, figures out ways to communicate this to Earth.
	- Grows his food on Mars, Science Bitch!
	- Rescue Mission, There's a Starman waiting in the sky!


### Exercise 4
Now you have 3 minutes to change the story into an original text 
Maybe steal from that list you wrote in the beginning 
	Something lights a spark 
Turn your Icelandic tail into your hamlet 
Romeo and Juliet into West Side Story

Okay, so same plot till he figures out that he is alone on a planet but the difference now is that, he need not worry about food this time, he has all the things he need to survive for about 2 years, i.e. till the next mission. So, Matt Damon doesn't need to move, they can communicate that he is alive but nothing more than that.

All he has is himself, some of his favorite music, books, movies & shows with him. But 2 years of time just to think, sit alone with his thoughts.

He realizes that all he needs to be happy is himself, he is not a jigsaw puzzle who needs to be completed by someone else. He is a pizza who he should be able to enjoy without the chitter chatter & the loud music. He can enjoy all his flavours without having to do small talk about how it is very cold & very hot today, how the traffic is the worst, how that girl got with that guy & how that person got fired from his job & how that kid topped the class.

It is difficult at the beginning but eventually talking to himself & really thinking about stuff gives him a unique edge. He returns back home & emphasizes the need to love oneself & be comfortable with the silence that comes with it.


### Exercise 5
What is the most important scene in that story? 
	he gets accepted on to the team 
	when they get up that mountain 
	when her imaginary magical powers turn out to be real 
	when she finally quit her job to pursue her budding career 
	what would you put in the trailer
when you have the answer 
write that scene (prose, screenplay or anything else)


He has communicated his well being to earth, there is nothing more to do there, no sense of urgency, things begin to calm down. The initial few days are miserable maybe, he is getting uncomfortable with this thoughts, but within a month or so, he comes to a cerebral breakthrough of sorts, he tries to find the inspiration (maybe his favorite piece of music, or a book he read last night)

He takes out his laptop, opens up obsidian & starts writing, he is basically journaling but at that moment it feels like more than that.

At the same time, back at earth, his family, friends find his journal (*which wasn't locked so no issues there*)
They start reading out his snippets from irregular journaling, no one has read that before & they begin to realize how deep this guy actually is.


### Conclusion to the exercise
Rok Sanda proves that ideas can come very cheap. We can all recreate stuff & discover something new within it. Especially if you prime your mind with an exercise like this.
We can steer it like a car.
