[[The Rise of the Note Maker]]

I don't want my knowledge experiences to fade out after a few months, instead I want them to give me the ability to use my knowledge in daily conversations & knowledge work.

So that I can ...
- Make sense out of experiences.
- Reference past thoughts & insights as I write new ones.


### My Digital Library
- It should be a joy to use.
- It shouldn't cause me anxiety because I have not paid attention to it in 3 days.
- It should be a place of calm & serenity.
- A place where I have a sense of control.
- Where I can develop ideas & revisit past memories.
