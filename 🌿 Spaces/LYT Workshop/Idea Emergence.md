- Emergence refers to formation of collected behavior
- What parts of systems do together that they wouldn't do by themselves?

> Divergence is when things become unique
> Convergence is when things become unified


> Emergence is where seemingly random things become "greater systems". The whole become the sum of it's parts.
> It's interesting to note that emergence makes use of both convergence & divergence at the same time.

- This is brilliantly demonstrated in the human body where ....
> Various cells come together to form new organism as a whole, so that you have hearts diverging in quality from lungs yet converging as parts of a greater circulatory & respiratory system.
