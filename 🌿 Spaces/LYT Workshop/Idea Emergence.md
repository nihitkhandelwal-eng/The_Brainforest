- Emergence refers to formation of collected behavior
- What parts of systems do together that they wouldn't do by themselves?

> Divergence is when things become unique
> Convergence is when things become unified
> Emergence is a mixture of both


> Emergence is where seemingly random things become "greater systems". The whole become the sum of it's parts.
> It's interesting to note that emergence makes use of both convergence & divergence at the same time.

- This is brilliantly demonstrated in the human body where ....
> Various cells come together to form new organism as a whole, so that you have hearts diverging in quality from lungs yet converging as parts of a greater circulatory & respiratory system.


Now, we will explore how idea emergence reveals itself in our link-based notes.

### Emergence Level 1
- We start from the **nothingness of fleeting thoughts** to the **somethingness of an externalized note**
- This is the *Primordial Idea Soup*
	- Ranging from memories, ideas, interactions, thoughts to any thing you come across. Anything that is below the surface of anything concrete or anything externalized

> [!abstract] Systems Perspective
> Between convergence (things becoming unified) & divergence (things becoming unique). This is more about Divergence.
