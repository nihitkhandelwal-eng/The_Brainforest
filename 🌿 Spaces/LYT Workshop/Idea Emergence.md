- Emergence refers to formation of collected behavior
- What parts of systems do together that they wouldn't do by themselves?

> Divergence is when things become unique
> Convergence is when things become unified
> Emergence is a mixture of both


> Emergence is where seemingly random things become "greater systems". The whole become the sum of it's parts.
> It's interesting to note that emergence makes use of both convergence & divergence at the same time.

- This is brilliantly demonstrated in the human body where ....
> Various cells come together to form new organism as a whole, so that you have hearts diverging in quality from lungs yet converging as parts of a greater circulatory & respiratory system.


Now, we will explore how idea emergence reveals itself in our link-based notes.

### Emergence Level 1
- We start from the **nothingness of fleeting thoughts** to the **somethingness of an externalized note**
- This is the *Primordial Idea Soup*
	- Ranging from memories, ideas, interactions, thoughts to any thing you come across. Anything that is below the surface of anything concrete or anything externalized

> [!abstract] Systems Perspective
> Between convergence (things becoming unified) & divergence (things becoming unique). This is more about Divergence.

### Emergence Level 2
- Once you link 2 notes, **direct relationships are formed**. This is the very basic concept of zettlekasten.
- As the connections grow, the system starts to come alive, naturally evolving itself. The beauty of the direct link is that bigger ideas start to emerge organically. There is however still a lack of clear perspective.
- The limitation right now is that you're always at eye-level with your notes, like you are on the ground floor in the forest. A bird's eye view is always helpful. ^808174

> [!abstract] Systems Perspective
> At this level, there is still more divergence than convergence.

### Emergence Level 3
- The solution is to make [[Higher Order Notes]]  
![[Higher Order Notes#What do they help with]]

> [!abstract] Systems Perspective
> Massive emergence, convergence & divergence happen here.

### Emergence Level 4
- At this point you are linking higher order notes. MOC's are linked to MOC's.
	- So at emergence level 4, MOC's can talk to each other to create something unique & seamless.
- Instead of having living system like zettelkasten, now we have living ecosystems.
- This allows you to fly around your note library rapidly & organically. Getting unforced behaviour driven spaced repetition.
- Nick says that this is a superior method of memory retention versus the anki's version of "rote like spaced repetition". #action/ðŸ“Œput-a-pin-on-that 

> [!abstract] Systems Perspective
> Less divergence happens here, but plenty of convergence does.

### Emergence Level 5
- This is your Home Note
- It consolidates new higher order notes with older, more mature higher order notes.
- **All roads lead to home.**

- The home note is the beginning & the end.
	- It is a launchpad & a homebase. 
	- It is a fixed point in the sky

> [!abstract] Systems Perspective
> The home note is all about convergence.
> - It allows for top down "Convergent" thinking like navigating & deliberate creating.
> - It also allows for bottom-up "Convergent" thinking by consolidating new forms of emergence.

### Comparison with living systems
Hierarchically organized linked notes emerge into a living system. #status/ðŸ’­think 

| Level | Note organization | Biologic metaphor | Brain metaphor                |
| ----- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1     | atomic notes      | Cell              | Development of a simple brain |
| 2     | linked notes      | Organ             | Working memory                |
| 3     | MOCs              | Organism          | Hippocampus                   |
| 4     | linked MOCs       | Ecosystem         | Corpus Callosum               |
| 5     | Home note         | Gaia              | Prefrontal Cortex             |

- The idea of a **simple brain** is the ability to take a stimulus & make a response i.e. an idea or a note.
- The **working memory** is the amount of the linked network of notes that can be retained at any given moment. We are limited to a few nodes and a few possible connections at a time by which to navigate this network. We will need a *long term memory or hippocampus* to be able to see beyond a few nodes worth of information at a time.
- The **Hippocampus** being developed gives us a powerful long term memory and really enables much more complex problem solving as more and more systems and algorithms may be stored in long term memory â€“ truly creating the opportunity for massive idea acceleration to take place.
- The **Corpus Callosum** allows us to move with lightning fast speed from *Top-Down Processing* to *Bottom-Up Processing* and back again in a flash of insight traversing up and down levels of abstraction to concrete details as needed.
  Here, once we are sufficiently warmed up, we also begin to see Quantum Effects â€“ Huge Leaps in Insight.
- The **Pre-Frontal Cortex** gives us the ability to execute plans as needed. whereas prior to this structure being in place we were still a little more driven by stimulus and response as opposed to strong intention and pre-planning. we can accelerate a plan from zero to 60 mph in 2 to 3 seconds. whereas before, we would really have to let things warm up a lot before we could accelerate to these kinds of speeds and beyond.
