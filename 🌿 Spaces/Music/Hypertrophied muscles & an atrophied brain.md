I don't wanna see things the way you taught.
Abuse, objectify & cover it with a gentleman knot.

Unconscious, atonic & an emetic episode
Is a dozed off mind what it takes to fulfil the "youth" code? ^659f2b

Smash a few bottles & sell it at the memories bar
Now getaway with "Kyun har cheez mein logic lagata hai yaar".
(The last line translates to "why do you want to use logic on everything"

 Uncertainty is something that we all hear, 
That's how destiny & karma please many ears.

There must be something, is what they say.
Appeal to ignorance paves there way.

If you see a rough patch, it's okay to adjust your pace. 
**You wanna stay on the track but it's not a race**

Be it fame, beauty or gloom, they all seduce.
Objectivity is something we don't wanna loose.
