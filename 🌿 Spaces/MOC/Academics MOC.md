### Anki Workflow
- I will be doing my anki mostly on my laptop/desktop
- Adding to notes
	1. Open OneNote
	2. Copy Paste in OneNote's pre-made categories
	3. Add the tag "important by either using the button at the top or pressing Ctrl+2"
- Every time I come across a card, I want to add to my notes, I will press Ctrl+7
