# Components of a Game
  1. Goals - This gives the player something to focus on
  2. Rules - Inform the user about how they can achieve the goal & what constraints are there. These rules empower the user by giving them a sense of control.
  3. Feedback System - This informs the user about how the current action relates to their goal.
