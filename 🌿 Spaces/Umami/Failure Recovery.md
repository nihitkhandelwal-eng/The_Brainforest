# Failure Recovery
-   Failure is inevitable & we cannot ignore it but there should be something to hang on after failure.
-   We can have many possible responses after failure & this has been successfully implemented by game developers
    -   Real life failure can also be thought of as a restart sometimes & we can have multiple strategies in response to failure to gamify even the failure part of our life.
    -   Example from games
        -   Let the player redeem what they've lost
        -   Give them a power-up to start off their next try with a boost
        -   When I fail in some goal or the path is of a failure trajectory , It could show me what skill I need to accomplish to avoid & overcome this failure
