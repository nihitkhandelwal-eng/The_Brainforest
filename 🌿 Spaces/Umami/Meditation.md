To meditate is like to build a telescope for your mind - Sam Harris #status/üçÉboat 
- Sam then goes on to give an analogy with astronomy about how it is only possible by real insight that one can learn how good & useful meditation can be.
- So, when we are in a city, we almost cannot see much in the night sky, but because we have experienced the beauty of 
it, when we were countryside or we have seen pictures of telescope, we know how good the night sky is.
- With respect to our mind, the conditions were never so good, meditation is a method for creating those conditions.
- Once this telescope is built, you may have to fine tune it from time to time but you have it then & there is a huge difference when you have recognized the sky of your mind with properly trained attention & never having looked up at all.
