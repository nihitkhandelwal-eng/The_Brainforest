- Interest is defined as curiosity or the feeling of an individual for a particular thing or activity. If a subject arouses the interest or curiosity of a person, it is said that his interests lie in that subject. 
- Interests refer to things or activities that a person is curious or concerned about. They are subjects or qualities that evoke his attention. 
- They can be things that someone does as a pastime or a leisure activity or those that he wants to have an occupation in. 
- Interests can be a personal desire to learn more about an activity or to educate yourself further about a topic to improve your work performance. 
- An interest can last a short amount of time or you can participate in it sporadically without the need to pursue it on an ongoing basis.
- For example, a personal interest could be to learn more about music by studying classical artists and pieces. 
	- On a professional level, a medical student pursuing neurology as their specialty would have an interest in learning more about the human brain.
- You may be interested a lot in football but still do not play it on the ground actively. This means you read a lot about football and also watch it on TV and stadiums as you are interested in the sport. 
	- Similarly, you are not yourself a politician but you are interested in politics and watch political news and current affairs programs on TV avidly.
