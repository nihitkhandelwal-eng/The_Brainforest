## Etymology
> ‘Hobby’ acquired its name from the wooden toy called the hobby horse which was ridden like a real horse. The expression ‘to ride one’s hobby horse’ means to follow a favorite pastime which led to the use of ‘hobby’ as a term for recreation. It is done for pleasure and enjoyment so there is no monetary reward for its practice. 

## What is a hobby?
- A hobby is an activity you may complete in your free time that brings you pleasure.
- When you're actively pursuing something outside of work hours, you're participating in a hobby. As you engage in your hobby, you're dedicating your time and energy to something you enjoy and are passionate about.
- Pursuing a hobby is often an ongoing experience that you can regularly commit to.

	- For example, some people like to take part in some adventurous outdoor activity whenever they get some leisure time. 
	- A hobby is one activity that makes people happy as they are able to forget tensions of their lives for some time. Many people listen to music in their leisure time and are lost in their musical world forgetting all about their worries and problems for the time being. 
		- There are others who collect stamps, a hobby that is called philately. 
		- Many collect coins of different countries and have a huge collection of old and rare coins of various countries of the world. This is a hobby that is referred to as numismatics.
