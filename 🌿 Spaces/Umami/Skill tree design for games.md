-   Based on the desired goal, we can have specific skills with specific requirements on how to earn them & this could show the player a clear path to achieve their goal
-   In the skill tree at the bottom are the highest powers possible & that is desirable to any player
-   Each skill can be names according to a goal & a skill tree can be named to a broader goal
-   Skills can & should exist in multiple locations
    -   So if I accomplish a skill for a goal , it should automatically accomplish it in other trees that it is a part of i.e. skills should be atomic
    -   This would let the player see that "ohh I have already accomplished these skills & now I only need this & this skill to accomplish my goal, so why not do that
