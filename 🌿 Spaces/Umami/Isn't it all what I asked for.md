>Is it me or my aching stomach
That's burning?
I have eaten too much, 
Why am I still starving?

>Is there a void inside me
O>r, Am I making one?
Is it really dark
Or, Am I too afraid to face the sun?

>Are those flickering desires or the extinguished ones
That are taking a toll on my throat?
Is the smoke suffocating me?
Or, Is it guiding me to stay afloat?

>In the race of conquering everything,
Have I lost my own boat?

>Does it mean anything,
when my temples hurt?
Are my eyes too weak
Or, Is it a straining alert?

>What is it that drives me mad?
What is it that keeps me going?
It hit me hard when someone said,
"It's fine. Everybody's not perfect!"

>Was I wrong to associate success with happiness
Or, Is it the other way around?
This took me some time to realise,
It's the boat and not me that has drowned.

>I heard my voice when I reached the shore,
"Isn't it all what I asked for?"
