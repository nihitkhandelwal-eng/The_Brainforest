![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1140/1*qGvKUwO0EyBuXMTCaE0yLw.png)


### Hobbies are continuous effort while adopting something & would be static.
- Reading a book can be a hobby for someone.
- A hobby can be something you do competitively, such as ballroom dancing, or something you do for enjoyment and stress relief, such as running half marathons or practicing the art of “noodling” (catching catfish with your bare hands.)
- Hobbies improve the quality of our lives by opening up our world to new passions and people we meet through the adventures we have. 
- Hobbies improve brainpower by building new mental pathways when you learn something new. 
- They provide an escape from the sometimes monotonous nature of daily life, and they help us learn something about ourselves in the process. 
- They can be a bonding experience, or an introspective exercise, or a way to meet new people.
- A hobby is something one likes to do in his past time, a spare-time recreational pursuit. 
- It is an action, something one does. 
- *Usually, hobbies need devotion; it is something that has to be done systematically.*

### Interests are short term effort while adapting to something.
- **Also reading a book might be an interest for someone and would be dynamic.**
- Interest has a broad scope which includes hobbies. 
- If one has an interest, they may or may not develop it into a hobby. If someone is somewhat interested in something, he may not pursue it actively. ==For example, he is interested in sky diving, but he hasn’t gone even once. ==
	- On the other hand, one will only pursue a hobby if he is interested in it. For example, she is interested in classic literature, her hobby is to collect and read old books, or, he is interested in birds, his hobby is bird watching. 
- Hobbies and interests are words that would seem like synonyms or at least interchangeable to most of us. Most of us have varied interests in life, in addition to the job we are doing. 
- Hobbies and interests are pursued in one’s pastime.


### How to Pick a Hobby That’s Right for You
- When picking a hobby, see what classes and activities are available near you. 
	- Do you live by a dance or yoga studio? 
	- Are you close to a lake that allows fishing? 
	- Do you have a place where you could create a garden in your yard? 
- The best hobbies are the ones that mesh well with your daily life. 
- **Part of the enjoyment of a hobby is the feeling of getting outside of your comfort zone.** See what kind of hobbies challenge you to do something new that you wouldn’t have done before. 
	- Never been in a yoga class? 
	- Unsure if you’ll be able to successfully learn to ski?
