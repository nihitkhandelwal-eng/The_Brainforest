## TRX
### Pronated Grip
#### Theory 
![[Chest Press.mp3]]
- Primary Muscle → Pectoral Major 
- While going back up, take your arms up a bit, if not, the weight then comes on shoulder 
- **Focus on Pectoral**
- If the hands here are bought closer inside, triceps will be involved, hence closed grip pushups involve triceps.

		- The one which rubs through the body
	- Can keep the arms away a bit so that it hurts less
