### The Great Loan Sanctioning

- I completed my internship in March 2021, upto that point, I was covered by my parents, which is a normal thing in India & it is absolutely perfect.
- After that, it's now 1.2 year now & I will be needing their financial support for at-least 2 more years, so 3.2 years. Let's round that off to 3.5 years
- Let's assume that the cost of me is 20000 ₹/month which gives us 240000 bucks. So for 3.5 years, 8.4 Lacs, lets round that off to 10 lacs i.e. 1 million ₹ i.e. 13000 $
- The USMLE Journey will cost me 25000 $ (including flight tickets, Visa, Stay in the US). 
  So I need 38000 $ i.e. 30 lac ₹

Daddy & Moma will be giving me that amount as a loan over the next 1.5 years, i.e. by the end of 2023

Now the thing is that the bank needs guarantee & they say that I am a "high risk client" & also a defaulter, so they need some good evidence i.e. my project reports


### The Big Transactions
I am calculating 20k/month as rent+maintainence
So, I will be keeping track of some of the big payments here.
