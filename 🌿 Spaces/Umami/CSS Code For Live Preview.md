Here is the code for both Edit (= CM5) and Reading mode:

```
.cm-s-obsidian, .markdown-preview-view {
  text-align: justify;
  hyphens: auto;
}
```

If, instead of Edit/CM5 you want Live Preview/CM6, you can replace `.cm-s-obsidian` by `.markdown-source-view.mod-cm6.is-live-preview`.

Having said that (last paragraph), it might not be sufficient (I have not checked), in which case you might also have to add the `.cm-s-obsidian`.
