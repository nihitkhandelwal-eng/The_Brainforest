You are that Wind Of May
Warm, comfortable and I can breath you all day
You are that beautiful moon of July
Peaceful, quiet and you make me fly
Your kindness is that rain in September
Vast. overwhelming and it makes me sober.

Your smile is like the pearls of sapphire
Euphoric, alcoholic and it is all I desire
Your words are like the tropical ocean
Full of warmth, vast and I can dive deeper in
emotion.

I wish we met when I was not suffering
You would have loved me, it would have a
meaning
I wish we met when I was happy
We would have laughed a lot together.

\- [[Shivansh]]
