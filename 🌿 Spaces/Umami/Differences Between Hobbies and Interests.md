### Hobbies are activities
- When you're participating in a hobby, you're actively participating in an activity or sport. Interests are often feelings or desires to learn more about subjects with the potential to become activities. 
	- For example, if you're interested in theater, you can occasionally study it and attend different performances. If you regularly participate in community theater performances, you can consider it a hobby.

### Hobbies are consistent
- When participating in a hobby, you're usually showing a regular dedication to it. 
	- For example, if your hobby is collecting stamps, you may consistently find new stamps and continue building your collection. 
- You can have an interest in various subjects depending on your mood, profession or attention span.

> As an example, if you work as a marketing professional, you could have an interest in learning about search engine optimization best practices. You can gain a certification that teaches you more about this topic. Once you receive this certification, your interest may decrease and you may start developing an interest in a separate subject.

### Interests can become hobbies
Since hobbies are activities and interests are a desire or feeling to complete or learn something, your interest can become your hobby. If you start to learn more about the subject and want to begin actively pursuing it, then it can turn into a regular hobby.

An example of this is if you study and read creative writing, then start writing creative pieces. You can consider the ongoing process of writing your own work as a hobby.

### You can make an income from an interest

If you develop an interest in a certain subject or if your supervisor asks you to study a topic to improve your job performance, you can make an income from it. The same can occur if you start learning a certain subject and then create a career out of it. For example, if you're interested in history and begin studying it, you can pursue a full-time career as a historian.

### You complete hobbies during your free time

You should complete hobbies during your downtime away from work. If you're making an income or participating in the activity during work hours, it's usually considered an interest rather than a hobby. Engaging in hobbies outside of work is a great way to maintain a strong work-life balance.

Participating in your hobby allows you to develop skills and challenge yourself by trying new activities. Hobbies are also an effective way to rest your brain and enjoy relaxing interests that are free from work-related tasks.
