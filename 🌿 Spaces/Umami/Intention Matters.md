# Intention Matters
-   The words you choose to describe something might & will affect the way to approach it. To be intentional about doing something, you need to be specific about your intentionality.
-   To be productive, you need to be intentional in phrasing about:
    -   The outcome you want to achieve
        -   otherwise you might waste your time with irrelevant tasks
    -   The time you want to spend to get to that particular outcome
        -   otherwise you are busy but not productive
    -   We must know [[How to write tasty tasks]]
