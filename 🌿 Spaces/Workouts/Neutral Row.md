## TRX
#### Theory 
![[Neutral Row.mp3]]
- The lever/force points at my chest & with my **wrist in neutral position**, I will pull it towards the midpoint of umbilicus & chest
- Primary Muscle Involved → Latissimus Dorsi & Trapezius
- Try to retract scapula here
- ‘L’ shape (90 degree angle) is to be maintained at elbow joint
	- This is only possible if I am pulling it towards the midpoint of chest & umbilicus 

##### How to increase intensity?
![[Neutral Row → Intensity Increased.mp3]]
- Push your leg forward till the point you might slip, then:
	- Raise the TRX Straps to the point where, if you lie down, you should not be able to hold the straps while lying down & then do the workout which is by far the coolest thing I have seen.
	- Be in the hip bridge position & hold hip in that position, pull your body up
	- If you want to increase the intensity further, don’t do the hip bridge position, instead keep your legs flat & then lift your whole body.
