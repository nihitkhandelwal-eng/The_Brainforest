Navigate your library of interests with a classification system modified for PKM. Make a scaffolding that can hold a lot of diverse areas, but only populate it with interests where you actually have some zest and zeal. This is an apathy-free zone.

## Categories
### Knowledge Management
The [[PKM MOC]] shows the best practices of knowledge management. I use the [[LYT Kit]] to show the power of linked thinking and to empower others to develop their thinking. The [[MOC MOC]] is my personal note to wrap my head around the wondrous beauty that MOCs offer.

### Personal Management
The [[Thinking MOC]] can galvanize my attention; the [[Concepts MOC]] can flavor it; and the [[Habits MOC]] speaks about how to direct it. Underpinning all is my [[Cabin ü™µ]] note. Others: [[Posture MOC]] and [[Hormesis MOC]] and [[Breathing Exercises MOC]].

## Commentary
### Choosing your Classification System
In case you were wondering, the above structure is based heavily on the Cutter and Universal Decimal classification systems. When in doubt, it's a wise move to use a pre-built, time-tested foundation to structure the interests of your digital library.

I wouldn't go overboard with numbering things. We‚Äôre just using a basic pre-made map as a fixed *spatial constellation* upon which to easily add dots of new interests. Too much structure stifles innovation and organic, emergent growth.

#### The structure of this classification system
- Me
	- 000 [[+Home|Knowledge Management]]
	- 100 Personal Management
	- 200 Philosophy & Psychology; Spirituality & Religion
- Us
	- 300 Social Sciences
	- 400 Communications & Rhetoric; Language & Linguistics
- Nature, Science, and Art
	- 500 Natural Sciences
	- 600 Applied Sciences
	- 700 Art & Recreation
	- 800 Literature
- History of Us
	- 900 History & Biography & Geography

### Other structures
There are other structures to consider. Depending on your classification needs, you may prefer more granularity, or less. Or you could go another direction and consider [The Donut of Knowledge](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1846/29852456427_d59d142757_b.jpg), which is fun, but it may not work as neatly. 


### Commentary on an A-Z list of MOCs
For those that want to maintain an alphabetical "Map of Maps" list, here's an incomplete example of the MOCs from above. It's incomplete, and actually no longer perfectly alphabetical since I've changed some of the names...which is why you should just use `#MOC` for your alphabetical list instead.

- [[Greco-Roman MOC]] - Greek, Roman
- [[Art MOC]]
- [[Confucianism MOC]]
- [[Cooking MOC]]
- [[Cosmology MOC]]
- [[Football MOC]]
- [[History MOC]]
- [[Building Homes MOC]]
- [[Language MOC]]
