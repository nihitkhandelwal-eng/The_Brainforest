" " Enu kaadi Depression ai ?"

" Enu kaadi Depression ei? Sab kuchh taan hai, " is the miffed response from many husbands when I tell them the wife has Clinical Depression.

And this is the most stubborn block in the public consciousness in understanding an illness which may or may NOT be triggered, caused, or worsened by stress.

Clinical Depression can happen in the richest, the most well-adjusted and so far, the happiest, life of the party person around you. And an intellectual knowledge about the working of mind does not help either. That is why mental health workers get it as often as others. It is the commonest mental health disorder. Often depression and anxiety co-exist.

In a hall of 200 attendees, at least 20 are likely to have depression.

It is not the only cause of suicide, but it is the commonest.

And it is treatable, the corollary being many suicides are preventable.

It is the elephant in the room.

Often Clinical Depression has no antecedent stress and sometimes a minor trigger can seem to be the whole cause.

Many times, what seems to be the cause is the result of early Depression. The adolescent, who was always a good student did not develop Depression because he failed but he failed because he was depressed. The man was not Depressed because he lost his job, he lost his job because he was Depressed. Often the cause and effect become tangled and cannot be neatly teased out one from the other. In any case treatment of Clinical Depression is the same ie treat the depression and the surrounding stress if any with medication or therapy or both. Both together work better than any one.
