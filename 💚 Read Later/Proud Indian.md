'I'm proud to be an Indian,' a friend said to me the other day.

'Basically what you're saying is you are proud not to be a Japanese,' I said.

'No, it's not like that,' he said. 'I like sushi and Murakami.'

'Okay then,' I said. 'So you are proud not to be ... hmmm ... Barbadian?'

'C'mon. It's not like that. I'm just proud to be Indian,' he said.

'How so? Explain.'

'Okay, it's like when we say I'm proud to be an IIT-ian or proud to be a doctor.'

'Ah,' I said. 'I get it now, thanks.'

'See,' said my proud Indian friend with a proud Indian smile.

'Let me clarify,' I said.

'Okay,' said my proud Indian friend with the proud Indian smile fading just a bit.

'Long ago,' I said. 'One resolute sperm in, say, a Greek man's loins decided it wanted to be Indian. Because Indians are THE greatest. So when the Greek man was about to fertilise an egg (in the conventional way), this one sperm swam against the tide, fought a million oncoming Greek sperm, escaped, and somehow (don't ask how) sought and found refuge in an Indian man's loins. Then it waited, training in the gym like Virat Kohli, and after several false alarms that could have had him going down the drain or fertilising a Thai or Canadian egg, became the one dogged sperm - among a million others that were all applying for Indian birth - to fertilise an Indian egg. And that hardworking, never-say-die sperm is you.'

The proud Indian used some very proud Indian words at me.

'Not true?' I said. 'I'm sorry. You mentioned pride so I thought you had great difficulty being born an Indian, yet chose to be one, fought insurmountable odds, and narrowly escaped being only half-Indian to finally fulfil your dream of becoming a whole Indian. And this was the only scenario I could come up with.'

Proud Indian friend threw a proud Indian punch at my nose.

'So wait a minute,' I said ducking. 'So you are a proud Indian because we teach yoga, have Netaji and Ambedkar on our roster and someone from here built the Brihadeeshwara a thousand years ago? Sorry, no can do. None of that has anything to do with you. Your pride stands cancelled. You are just plain Indian.'

I have one Indian friend less now.
