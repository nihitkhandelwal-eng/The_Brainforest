In Hindu society where there was no property inheritance for women, many women from rich family saw Dowry(Stridhana) as a way to access paternal wealth. They defended it as a choice of girl's family. Just like many of their sisters opposed Hindu Code Bill which emancipated women but struck hard on caste structure that enriched them.

But the social implications of this unreasonable practice of Dowry were grave. There were larger number of families that could not afford to meet social expectations set by it. A law to provide protection to those who were forced into this practice was necessary and right. But it needed an approach that was invested in humanity and justice for the victim. Its punitive side was a deterrent for culprits but it's goals were more or less honest because they centred the vulnerable.

It is not hard to sense the lack of this level of honesty from the government apparatus in Karnataka. It stinks of misogyni, hatred for Muslims and attempt to create polarisation.

Though it may very well be a choice for those who can afford to, I understand that girls being forced into religious attires that stunts their social growth is a problem across several religions in subcontinent. A solution to protect victim of this will keep her at center. Not punish her for her misery. It will respond to her demands, not dictate solutions to her.

If, on the other hand, the Sanghis claim that they are trying to get rid of display of religious symbols in schools, I know a few things I will want to tear down first...
