In [[psychodynamic writings, based most centrally on
definitions from Sigmund Freud (1920) and Anna
Freud (1964), trauma is defined in terms of stimulation
that exceeds the individual’s ability to cope]]
[[S. Freud (1920) famously spoke of traumatic stress
as the result of “an extensive breach being made in
the protective shield against stimuli” (p. 31)]], a [[consequence
of a rupturing of the interface between the
internal and external world within the survivor’s
mind]]

from a [[psychodynamic perspective,
a negative event can at times be seen as a trauma
almost entirely because of its magnitude in some
instances]], but in other instances, it would achieve
this status because of the [[inadequacy of the individual
ego as a result of youth, mental illness,
an unsupportive environment, or other forms of
vulnerability]].

[[The psychoanalytic tradition also inspired an
initial understanding of trauma as leading to impacts
that are fleeting.]] Thus, prolonged reactions to an
event were caused not by the event itself, but by premorbid
experiences.

[[Ferenczi’s definition of trauma crossed two moments in time]]—[[the initial experience of the event and the point at which the reaction
of the child or young adult was disavowed or rejected by the people on whom he or she depends]].

formulation stressed the[[context of the
TE, consistent with later research showing the much
lower rates of PTSD in children and adults who had
strong social support at the time of the trauma or
shortly thereafter (e.g., Dyb et al., 2014)]]. [[Analysts
in the Ferenczi tradition, such as Balint (1959), thus
argue that trauma can be understood and defined
only in a two-person psychology]] and cannot be
defined as an [[experience that occurs to a single
individual isolated in time and space]].

[[Ferenczi was also the primary theorist involved in
the development of early psychoanalytic theories
of dissociation]], pointing out that [[trauma memory
may not be repressed, as in Freudian theory, but
may not have been recorded because of splits in the
personality]].

[[Hans Selye (1956), who first coined the term stress and hypothesized that stress reactions were mediated by the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis]]. [[Selye described a general adaptation syndrome, thought to be healthy, conceiving of the traumatic neuroses as the result of a chronic or severe exposure to stress]]. Thus, [[gross stress reaction, an early precursor diagnosis to acute stress disorder (ASD) and PTSD that appeared in  DSM–I (American Psychiatric Association, 1952)]], was [[defined as occurring in those who were otherwise normal but responding to overwhelming fear]]. 

[[Unlike the analytic tradition, the biological tradition inspired animal
models, and quickly fused with the research traditions of those studying the fight-or-flight response to threat or aggression]] (Cannon, 1929). [[Later theorists expanded the model to fight-flight-freeze (Bracha, Ralston, Matsukawa, Williams, & Bracha, 2004), with the freeze reaction considered to be a dissociative response]].

[[Behaviorist theories informed the first empirically based therapies
of phobia, an anxiety disorder that can follow a fear-inducing experience]]. [[Such therapies could be designed and implemented without the need for labeling the experience of the client as fear,
helplessness, or horror]].

Although behavioral paradigms apply to individuals regardless of predisposition, much evidence has accumulated that [[fear conditioning
happens more easily in some people than in others, in part because of brain structure differences such as amygdala volume]] (De Bellis et al., 2000).

As noted earlier,
[[gross stress reaction was labeled specifically as a
condition that could occur when a normal personality
was placed under abnormal stress and differed
from the neuroses presented in other portions of
the manual by its tie to a trauma]], its reversibility,
and its transient character. [[Gross stress reaction was
diagnosed only when a person had been exposed
to extremities of physical demand or stress]].

[[When PTSD appeared in the DSM–III (American
Psychiatric Association, 1980), the definition of the
qualifying event had markedly changed]]. [[Criterion
A, which included the definition of trauma, was
designed to serve a gatekeeping function for the 
disorder ]](Kilpatrick, Resnick, & Acierno, 2009).

[[This definition of trauma
was slightly amended with DSM–III–R]] (American
Psychiatric Association, 1987), [[with reference to a
stressor that is “outside the range of usual human
experience and that would be markedly distressing
to almost anyone” (p. 250).]]

[[serious threat to one’s life or physical
integrity; serious threat or harm to one’s
children, spouse, or other close relatives
and friends[[; [[sudden destruction of one’s
home or community; or seeing another
person who has recently been, or is
being, seriously injured or killed as the
result of an accident or physical violence[[.
(p. 250)

[](<The DSM–III (American Psychiatric Association,
1980) and DSM–III–R (American Psychiatric Association,
1987) definitions include at least two of the themes that have been used to define trauma listed in Table 2.1—[[Nonordinary Events and Universal Emotional Response. Both requirements—that the event be outside the range of usual human experience and that it be markedly distressing to almost anyone]]—[[emphasize the normality of a
response to trauma and deemphasize the likelihood>)
of strong premorbid indicators other than the magnitude
of the stressor]]. [[By including threat to life
or physical integrity, which requires a cognitive
assessment by the individual, the definition also
includes a specific cognitive assessment requirement]]
(see Table 2.1).>)

[[Carlson and colleagues (2011) found high rates of reporting
of at least one such nonordinary event (labeled
a high-magnitude stressor [HMS])]] in [[samples of
university students (72.4% positive ...),
young adults (82% positive), adults (87%
positive), and homeless veterans (98% positive).
Comparable findings (60% and higher) appeared in
studies of older Americans]] (Norris, 1992; Resnick,
Kilpatrick, Dansky, Saunders, & Best, 1993) and
in studies using non-American samples (Carey,
Stein, Zungu-Dirwayi, & Seedat, 2003; Frans,
Rimmö, Åberg, & Fredrickson, 2005; Kawakami,
Tsuchiya, Umeda, Koenen, & Kessler, 2014; Mills
et al., 2011).>)

[[Sexual abuse of children also is no
longer seen as rare]] (Pereda, Guilera, Forns, & Gómez-
Benito, 2009) but is ''explicitly included in
the DSM–IV (American Psychiatric Association,
1994) as a potential trauma]].

[[DSM–IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994)
moved away from the designation of certain events
as causing distress in almost everyone]] and defined
[[trauma by both the experience of certain types of
events and by a specific emotional reaction (in particular,
fear, helplessness, or horror) to those events]].
[[The classification of the event type is referred to as
Criterion A1, and the emotional reaction requirement
is Criterion A2]].

In the typical A1 comparison
study, the target events (often the worst event that
the individual has experienced by his or her own
self-report) were classified as meeting or not meeting
the qualification of a TE in the relevant DSM
PTSD edition. The likelihood of PTSD or the severity
of PTSD on a continuously scored measure then
could be calculated.

A complication of the type of event method of
denoting trauma, at least as it was operationalized
in the [[DSM–IV (American Psychiatric Association,
1994), is that professional raters disagree significantly
as to whether certain events do fit the criterion]].
Bodkin and colleagues (2007) [[achieved an 87%
agreement between two raters, but reported rates
of agreement fall, as might be expected, as numbers
of raters increase]].

[[Gender differences between raters is one potential
(and untested) source for such differences in categorization]].

[[The change in trauma definition from an event
that would cause distress in nearly everyone ... DSM-III
to events meeting varying specific characteristics,
such as threat to life or physical integrity]] (DSM–IV;
American Psychiatric Association, 1994),

DSM–IV’s Criterion A2 The second part of Criterion A in DSM–IV
(American Psychiatric Association, 1994) [[required
that response to the traumatic experience involve
intense feelings of fear, helplessness, or horror, a
specific peritraumatic reaction definition]] (see Table
2.1). Although the [[specific time of this response
was not specified, Criterion A2 was typically
interpreted to refer to responses that occurred
during the TE or immediately thereafter]] (Carlson
et al., 2011).

The [[choice of the fear, helplessness, and horror
emotions was theoretically driven, influenced by the increasing interest in the role of the fight-flight-freeze response and
its application to PTSD]] (Foa, Riggs, Massie, &
Yarczower, 1995; Kent, Sullivan, & Rauch, 2000).

Foa and colleagues (1995), examining the [[outcome
of exposure therapy in female assault survivors,
found that those who showed facial signs of fear
during the process (indicating activation of the
fear network) were more likely to benefit from
treatment]], whereas [[those who showed more anger
benefited less from treatment]]. [[Fear, and fear-related
physiological response, was viewed as an adaptive response to danger, problematic only when it became nonadaptive after danger had passed]].

The [[presence of intense fear did predict PTSD
and other traumatic consequences after major negative
events]], supporting the specific peritraumatic
reaction definition of trauma (Brewin, Andrews, &
Rose, 2000). Research subsequent to the publication
of DSM–IV (American Psychiatric Association,
1994), however, [[almost universally found
that intense emotions other than fear, helplessness,
and horror also were associated with PTSD after an
A1 event]] (e.g., Adler, Wright, Bliese, Eckford, &
Hoge, 2008; Rizvi, Kaysen, Gutner, Griffin, &
Resick, 2008), favoring an intensity of peritraumatic reaction definition.

much discussion occurred about expanding the definition
of trauma to include various [[other emotional reactions
(a general intense reaction definition), perhaps
including shame, anger, sadness, or effroi]] (Hathaway
et al., 2010; Vaiva et al., 2003). The latter term is a
French word, with the [[closest translation being terror
or fright, ... as experiencing “a transitory feeling of complete
absence of affect]] (p. 396) that [[occurs upon confrontation
with the reality of death]]. [[Vaiva and colleagues
(2003) reported a 17-fold increase in the likelihood
of PTSD in those who experienced effroi at the time
of their alleged trauma, as compared with those who
did not.]]

Theoretically, a [[trauma in this case was
defined in terms of an enduring defensive orientation]],
an [[event that produced a heightened preparatory
state for further negative events]]. [[In light of the
theoretical understanding of trauma as activating
the stress response system]], [[it becomes less clear why
anger (fight in the fight-flight-freeze response)]] or
[[tonic immobility and dissociation (associated with
the freeze response and with lack of access to emotions)
were not part of the definition in the DSM–IV]]
(American Psychiatric Association, 1994)

Even [[after years of wrangling, the DSM–5 definition
still may be problematic]]. The [[final definition is a
mix of specific lists of qualifying events and events
that are appraised in terms such as threatening or
aversive]], a specific cognitive assessment definition.
It is also [[unclear in the criteria whether the appraisal
of the event as threatening or extreme should be a
judgmen]]] [[made entirely by the evaluator or entirely
by the patient or whether it should emerge through
consensus]].

evaluators attempting to create a clinically useful instrument did believe that there was some need to tolerate subjectivity (such
as the word threat) in the definition. The definition,
however, needed to be tied to a reality base. McNally
(2004) wrote on this issue that “when appraisal
closely tracks reality, it becomes redundant with
objective features of the event. When appraisal overestimates
threat, vulnerability factors are likely to
account for more of the variance than properties of
the event itself” (p. 5).

[[DSM–5 (American Psychiatric Association,
2013) also contains the first explicit statement that
PTSD is possible even if the person has not personally
experienced the threat or witnessed the event]]
but instead was[[]] exposed to gruesome details of TEs
through professional duties]]

The current definition of trauma in [[DSM–5
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013) excludes
a variety of events that plausibly could produce
elevations in PTSD symptoms]].

Carlson, Smith, and Dalenberg (2013) also showed when [[severe emotional loss was incorporated into the definition of trauma, additional variance was accounted for in the prediction
of PTSD symptoms]].

Dekel, Solomon, Horesh, and Ein-Dor (2014) found that both [[depression and PTSD symptoms were elevated after trauma, and
although PTSD mediated the severity of depression,
so too did depression mediate the severity of PTSD]].
[[Depression is a frequent correlate of trauma in
the psychiatric literature]] (e.g., see Spinhoven,
Penninx, van Hemert, de Rooij, & Elzinga, 2014),
but[[research also has linked trauma and trauma
severity to dissociation and dissociative disorders
(Carlson, Dalenberg, & McDade-Montez, 2012;
Dalenberg et al., 2012), panic disorder (Liu, Sareen,
Bolton, & Wang, 2015), generalized anxiety
disorder (Park et al., 2014), and somatoform disorder]]
(Park et al., 2014).

Given the research that suggests
that [[trauma may alter DNA methylation (Meaney,
2001) and may lead to epigenetic modification of
gene expression]], the argument that [[trauma may
have a long-lasting or even permanent impact on
the neurochemistry and structure of the brain has
received more attention]] (Schore, 2001). Bipolar
patients who report exposure to trauma appear to
have earlier onset (Leverich et al., 2002) and higher
likelihood of hallucinations (Hammersley et al.,
2003) than those who do not, and Thompson and
colleagues (2014) have shown that [[sexual trauma
was associated with the onset of psychosis in a highrisk
sample]]. A more general [[definition of trauma,
uncoupled from the diagnosis of PTSD, therefore
would be preferable]].

A useful beginning has been made by many
researchers with the use of such [[terms as potentially
traumatic event, potential traumatic stressor (PTS),
or HMS rather than TE or traumatic stressor (TS)
to refer to many of the events or circumstances that
have been discussed thus far]] (e.g., Anders, Frazier, &
Shallcross, 2014; Guru Rajan et al., 2014; Kilpatrick
et al., 1998; Park et al., 2014). [[HMS should be used
for the specific events that have been shown statistically
to lead to sudden and measurable elevations in
psychological symptomology in substantial numbers
of individuals]]. These events typically are listed on
trauma exposure measures as they now stand.

Thus, [[HMS would clearly refer to the nature of the event,
and acute stressor (AS) could be applied to an HMS
that in fact did cause significant distress at the time
Defining Trauma of occurrence]]. This [[distress need not be restricted to fear, helplessness, and horror, but it should be of
moderate to extreme severity as defined by a valid
measure of the relevant construct]]. The [[TS label
would be reserved for those HMS events that caused
long-term distress or cognitive change (see the
section “Meaning”)]].

When we move to [[attempts to assess the severity
of trauma, the definitions become even more diverse]].
As seen in the nonexhaustive list in Table 2.4, [[severity
can be operationalized as a self-rating of the
individual]] (Armstrong & Shakespeare-Finch, 2011;
Weiss et al., 2010), by frequency of experience
of events on a given list (Maercker, Beauducel, &
Schützwohl, 2000), by frequency of events meeting
Criterion A (Ford, Stockton, Kaltman, & Green,
2006), by timing or circumstance of the events
(Kluemper & Dalenberg, 2014), or by a weighted
combination of these factors (Bottoms, Najdowski,
Epstein, & Badanek, 2012). A professional consensus
meeting on the topic would be most useful at
this point, perhaps to develop a list of testable definition
alternatives.>)

It is possible that[[ severity of trauma could be
brought empirically in line with other medically
relevant definitions of severity]]. Definitions of [[severe
conditions of cold, heat, or starvation can be tied on
the one hand to physical requirements such as number
of days without food or hours of exposure to a
given temperature]]. The specific [[cutoffs for moderate
versus severe, however, would be determined by
likelihood of damages produced by such exposure]]
(e.g., burns, frostbite, specific levels of fever) or the
[[degree of time and intervention necessary to return
the individual to homeostasis]] (e.g., in energy, temperature,
and flexibility). In classifying severity of
burns, for instance, first-, second-, and third-degree
burns are diagnosed largely by appearance (redness,
blistering, or blackened and charred skin) and by
likelihood of long-term scarring and need for protracted
treatment.
	   
Again, such [[reliable and agreed-upon definitional lists can be
applied to HMS events—those events that are most
likely to be traumatic—and can be studied with or
without reference to the individual’s meaning structures]].
Nonetheless, many widely accepted findings
imply that [[meaning associated with the event is
independently predictive (controlling for other
measures of severity) of long-term consequences
and of the likely occurrence of those disorders
that we label posttraumatic]]

For instance, in the literature on interpersonal trauma, the [[effects of HMS events perpetrated by an intimate other are reliably more predictive of PTSD and other posttraumatic distress types than are noninterpersonal HMS events or interpersonal events perpetrated by a stranger]] (Alisic et al., 2014; M. Price, Higa-McMillan, Kim, & Frueh, 2013). In Alisic et al.’s[ ](2014) meta-analysis of PTSD prevalence rates  in [[trauma-exposed children and adolescents, PTSD occurred after noninterpersonal HMS events among 8.4% of boys and 13.3% of girls but showed higher rates (16.8% of boys and 32.9% of girls) after
interpersonal HMS events]]. 

Foa, Ehlers, Clark, Tolin, and Orsillo (1999)
found that [[negative appraisals of the meaning of
a trauma and negative predictions regarding the
implications of that trauma for the self and world
are predictive of PTSD and general distress severity]].
This finding has been replicated repeatedly with use
of Foa et al.’s Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory
(PTCI; Carper et al., 2015; Koo, Nguyen, Gilmore,
Blayney, & Kaysen, 2014; McLean, Yeh, Rosenfield, &
Foa, 2015). Appraisal instruments such as the PTCI include questions regarding [[views of self and world
that are common after trauma and that lead to other
nonproductive coping mechanisms]]. Examples of
[[trauma-related cognitive distortions are extreme
types of global self-blame (“someone else could have
prevented this”)]], [[alienation from the world (“people
can’t be trusted”), and views that the self is now
tainted (“I am a weak person”)]].

[[Research on meaning tends to focus on core
schemas that filter the experience of large groups
of people]]. The [[most frequently studied domains
for such beliefs are control, predictability, fairness,
justice, coherence, benevolence, justice, luck, and
personal vulnerability]] (Janoff-Bulman, 1989, 1992).

This is quite reminiscent of the [[psychoanalytic view 
of the trauma as overwhelming the ego’s ability to 
cope effectively]].  Alternatively, [[meaning-centered 
definitions refer to a forced change in the individual’s 
self-definition]]

Pearlman and Saakvitne (1995) defined [[trauma
as present if, after a threat to life, bodily integrity,
or sanity, “the individual’s ability to integrate his/
her emotional experience is overwhelmed”]] (p. 60).
[[Integration appears to refer to the individual’s
ability to make sense of the experience within current
cognitive and emotional frameworks and thus
is a meaning-centered definition]]. [[HMS-
exposed individuals are thought to need to process the
trauma, typically by talking about it (Lepore,
Ragan, & Jones, 2000), but perhaps also by writing
about it]] (Kearns, Edwards, Calhoun, & Gidycz,
2010; Pennebaker, 1999). This is one apparent
mechanism for the well-replicated finding
that [[social support facilitates recovery from trauma]]
(Bryant-Davis, Ullman, Tsong, & Gobin, 2011;
Harper, Stalker, Palmer, & Gadbois, 2005).
[[Religion or spirituality also may play a role for
some in the processing or reintegration of the event
into an acceptable life plan or life story]] (McIntosh,
Silver, & Wortman, 1993).

The [[definitional tasks in the area of trauma psychology
remain significant]]. [[Trauma has been defined by
the experience of certain events and by universal
or specific cognitive or emotional reactions to such
events]]. Further empirical work on the predictive
validity of varying definitions is needed. At present,
it would be useful to begin to [[distinguish between
events that are commonly associated with traumatic
reactions (HMS)]], [[HMS events that have led to
acute distress in a given individual (AS), and [[HMS
events that have been followed by a constellation
of trauma-related symptoms or an appraisal-based
change in behavior and worldview (TS]]).
