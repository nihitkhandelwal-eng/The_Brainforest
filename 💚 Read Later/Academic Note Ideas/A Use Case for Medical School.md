Multiple people commented under my last post asking about my workflow with Obsidian as a medical student, so I wanted to make a somewhat detailed post explaining it. Note that I only started using Obsidian 2 months ago, so this is a work in progress. Also, a caveat: your mileage may vary. The brilliance of Obsidian is in its customizability, allowing you to mold the software to your style of thinking - NOT the other way around!!! Only use this for inspiration, not as a definitive guide on how to use Obsidian for medical students.

First, this is what my setup looks like:

[![r/ObsidianMD - A Use Case for Medical School](https://preview.redd.it/hnxbk0wezku81.png?width=1915&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c96ba20e2d263ab280b0ecd69e20d88cccaf49a)](https://preview.redd.it/hnxbk0wezku81.png?width=1915&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c96ba20e2d263ab280b0ecd69e20d88cccaf49a)

It's simple enough, I have a local graph and search bar on the right side. Note that nodes have different colors based on their tags. I usually tag something as `#dz` (for disease), or `#tx` (for treatments/drugs), or something like that.

Here's an example of one of my notes; this is my page on Gout.

[![r/ObsidianMD - A Use Case for Medical School](https://preview.redd.it/8qcdbo390lu81.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=169c3913ff2f01ea87710de8cb28785396913290)](https://preview.redd.it/8qcdbo390lu81.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=169c3913ff2f01ea87710de8cb28785396913290)

I have some images I screenshotted from a textbook, along with some important details that I copied down. I use maybe 5 different templates: one for diseases, one for drugs, etc. On the right you can see that gout is linked to a number of concepts - loop diuretics, because they may cause gout as a side effect. Also Polycythemia Vera, because it can cause gout as a symptom. Simple enough, right?

One of the advantages of Obsidian for notetaking is its **speed**. Instead of searching through Notability or OneNote for minutes, I can find a note here in seconds. This has obvious benefits for a career in which you have to learn thousands of diseases, pathogens, and drugs and review them constantly, as your knowledge about the topics also constantly grows. Obsidian is perfectly geared to handle this.

Another key feature for me is **anki integration**, through an excellent plugin. It allows me to very quickly make anki cards from my notes for spaced repetition. This is infinitely better than making cards within anki itself, because I can more easily come back to my notes and edit them, and the anki cards will change accordingly. You can see here that I have curly brackets around {monosodium urate}, so the plugin will generate a flashcard with monosodium urate blocked out. If a new drug were to come to market for the treatment of gout tomorrow, I would type it into this note, add a cloze deletion, and it would generate an anki card pretty seamlessly. Most medical students spend hours a day making flash cards, I spend really no time at all beyond my normal note-taking.

Another part of my workflow is using **Excalidraw** which is an amazing plugin, and it is unbelievable to me that the plugin is free (the creator has a link to donate, so consider supporting him). I use this mostly to draw pathways because I like to think in pathways, but again, your use case could be very different. Here is one diagram I made in Excalidraw:

[![r/ObsidianMD - A Use Case for Medical School](https://preview.redd.it/b7eu8xje3lu81.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=31cba37804167528ada77ce9a02f2617e8c8b848)](https://preview.redd.it/b7eu8xje3lu81.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=31cba37804167528ada77ce9a02f2617e8c8b848)

It's very easy to edit and allows me to compile a dozen processes into one big pathway. Now let's zoom in.

[![r/ObsidianMD - A Use Case for Medical School](https://preview.redd.it/qn313ghn3lu81.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=774b1330aed795f64594985f5f58aa441794e646)](https://preview.redd.it/qn313ghn3lu81.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=774b1330aed795f64594985f5f58aa441794e646)

See that link next to Uric Acid? That's gout, because gout is caused by an accumulation of uric acid. If I want to take a look at my notes on gout, I simply click the hyperlink.

One last thing: I use the **local graph** pretty heavily. It's a nice way to visualize where I am in relation to other topics. An example:

[![r/ObsidianMD - A Use Case for Medical School](https://preview.redd.it/ve6bbbxx4lu81.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=a92d70ed8c03882447bc99dd5bd7555f6225d4df)](https://preview.redd.it/ve6bbbxx4lu81.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=a92d70ed8c03882447bc99dd5bd7555f6225d4df)

This is what shows up in my local graph when I open my page for the neurotransmitter GABA. Linked to this page are drugs like lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and gabapentin, which are used to treat seizure (hence the link to my page on seizure with those drugs). GABA is also linked to Clostridium tetani, because infection by that pathogen messes with GABA, resulting in what you probably recognize as symptoms of tetanus.

That's pretty much my workflow. I have some custom keyboard shortcuts to speed things along a bit, and Obsidian's possibilities are endless so this is far from comprehensive. Just do what works for you, but this is how I do things.
