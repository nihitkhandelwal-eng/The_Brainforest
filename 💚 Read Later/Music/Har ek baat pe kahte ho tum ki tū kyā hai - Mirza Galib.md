har ek baat pe kahte ho tum ki tū kyā hai

tumhīñ kaho ki ye andāz-e-guftugū kyā hai

at every turn you question me, asking what are you?'

tell me pray what manner of speech do you pursue?

na sho.ale meñ ye karishma na barq meñ ye adā

koī batāo ki vo shoḳh-e-tund-ḳhū kyā hai

neither flames this magic nor lightning this charm do have

who's this stormy quicksilver beauty I wish I knew

ye rashk hai ki vo hotā hai ham-suḳhan tum se

vagarna ḳhauf-e-bad-āmozi-e-adū kyā hai

I am not afraid my foe will corrupt your mind somehow

I am merely jealous that he gets to talk to you

chipak rahā hai badan par lahū se pairāhan

hamāre jaib ko ab hājat-e-rafū kyā hai

my clothes are caused, by oozing blood, to cling unto my frame

what need is there now for my vest to be darned anew?

jalā hai jism jahāñ dil bhī jal gayā hogā

kuredte ho jo ab raakh justujū kyā hai

with my body consigned to flames, my heart too would have burnt

why do you rake the ashes now, what is it you pursue?

ragoñ meñ dauḌte phirne ke ham nahīñ qaa.il

jab aañkh hī se na Tapkā to phir lahū kyā hai

merely because it courses through the veins, I'm not convinced

if it drips not from one's eyes blood cannot be held true

vo chiiz jis ke liye ham ko ho bahisht aziiz

sivā.e bāda-e-gulfām-e-mushk-bū kyā hai

save for fragrant flavoured wine, what else can it be

that for which we paradise persistently pursue

piyūñ sharāb agar ḳhum bhī dekh luuñ do-chār

ye shīsha o qadah o kuuza o subū kyā hai

glasses goblets jugs and pitchers all are of no use

even if in barrels found, I'd gladly drink the brew

rahī na tāqat-e-guftār aur agar ho bhī

to kis umiid pe kahiye ki aarzū kyā hai

no longer have I strength to speak but even if I did

what hope can I rely on to narrate my wish to you?

huā hai shah kā musāhib phire hai itrātā

vagarna shahr meñ 'ġhālib' kī aabrū kyā hai

becoming the the crony of the king, he preens and struts around

or else what honour in this town to Ghalib would accrue?

har ek baat pe kahte ho tum ki tu kya hai

tumhin kaho ki ye andaz-e-guftugu kya hai

at every turn you question me, asking what are you?'

tell me pray what manner of speech do you pursue?

na shoale mein ye karishma na barq mein ye ada

koi batao ki wo shoKH-e-tund-KHu kya hai

neither flames this magic nor lightning this charm do have

who's this stormy quicksilver beauty I wish I knew

ye rashk hai ki wo hota hai ham-suKHan tum se

wagarna KHauf-e-bad-amozi-e-adu kya hai

I am not afraid my foe will corrupt your mind somehow

I am merely jealous that he gets to talk to you

chipak raha hai badan par lahu se pairahan

hamare jaib ko ab hajat-e-rafu kya hai

my clothes are caused, by oozing blood, to cling unto my frame

what need is there now for my vest to be darned anew?

jala hai jism jahan dil bhi jal gaya hoga ^920cb7

kuredte ho jo ab rakh justuju kya hai

with my body consigned to flames, my heart too would have burnt

why do you rake the ashes now, what is it you pursue?

ragon mein dauDte phirne ke hum nahin qail

jab aankh hi se na Tapka to phir lahu kya hai

merely because it courses through the veins, I'm not convinced

if it drips not from one's eyes blood cannot be held true

wo chiz jis ke liye hum ko ho bahisht aziz

siwae baada-e-gulfam-e-mushk-bu kya hai

save for fragrant flavoured wine, what else can it be

that for which we paradise persistently pursue

piyun sharab agar KHum bhi dekh lun do-chaar

ye shisha o qadah o kuza o subu kya hai

glasses goblets jugs and pitchers all are of no use

even if in barrels found, I'd gladly drink the brew

rahi na taqat-e-guftar aur agar ho bhi

to kis umid pe kahiye ki aarzu kya hai

no longer have I strength to speak but even if I did

what hope can I rely on to narrate my wish to you?

hua hai shah ka musahib phire hai itraata

wagarna shahr mein 'ghaalib' ki aabru kya hai

becoming the the crony of the king, he preens and struts around

or else what honour in this town to Ghalib would accrue?
