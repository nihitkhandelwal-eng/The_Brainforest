## *How to Take Smart Notes* by Sönke Ahrens

[![](https://cdn.getmidnight.com/de7a8f7c083abf41a583073d8704ea72/2022/03/how-to-take-smart-notes-ahrens.jpg)](https://takesmartnotes.com/)

*[How to Take Smart Notes](https://takesmartnotes.com/)* by Sönke Ahrens

## What this book offers

One of the best-known books in the personal knowledge management space, written by a professor in the Philosophy of Education. [Dr. Sönke Ahrens](https://takesmartnotes.com/about/) walks through the process of setting up a Zettelkasten personal knowledge management system based on “atomic notes” aka the smallest available pieces of information, then linking them together. His work is strongly influenced by Niklas Luhmann’s original Zettelkasten system, as reflected in Luhmann’s essay [Communicating with Slip Boxes: An Empirical Account](https://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes). If you’re interested in the philosophy of the Zettelkasten method, this is the place to start.

> Take Smart Notes is a project dedicated to helping students, academics and nonfiction writers get more done - ideally with more fun and less effort. I never found a book on how to organize academic and nonfiction writing convincing enough that I felt good about recommending it to my students.
> 
> There are great books on time- and self-management in general, like David Allen’s “Getting Things Done,” but they usually don’t work for an open-ended process like research. Specific books on academic writing, on the other hand, are usually more collections of tips and tricks and not systematic enough to make a real difference.
> 
> I spent a lot of time trying out different note-taking systems and started four times over with different slip-boxes: Two on different sizes of paper and one in HTML before I settled with Lüdecke’s Zettelkasten. I learned a lot about what works and what doesn’t. As someone said: Learning from experience is the best way to learn - especially if it is the experience of others.

How to take smart notes

While there are hundreds of thousands of books on the generic topic of writing, very few concerns themselves with note-taking—perhaps because it’s not considered an intellectually challenging task by many, or perhaps because many people don’t realise how bad they are at taking notes. Looking at a bl…

## *Digital Zettelkasten: Principles, Methods, and Examples* by David Kadavy

[![](https://cdn.getmidnight.com/de7a8f7c083abf41a583073d8704ea72/2022/03/digital-zettelkasten-kadavy.jpg)](https://books2read.com/u/31loJM)

*[Digital Zettelkasten](https://payhip.com/b/Aw6LZ)* by David Kadavy

Author, podcaster, and self-publishing coach David Kadavy was inspired to write his “short read” book on digital zettelkasten after [writing a popular blog post on the topic of Zettelkasten](https://kadavy.net/blog/posts/zettelkasten-method-slip-box-digital-example/). In his post about [the book on Reddit,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/comments/nn772y/i_wrote_the_book_i_wish_i_had_when_i_started/) he reports that he appreciated the philosophy and “why” of other articles and books on Zettelkasten, but wished he’d had a clearer path on “how” to build a digital zettelkasten.

## Author’s description of Digital Zettelkasten

> When I first started using the Zettelkasten method I was very frustrated with the information out there. But, as a nonfiction author, I had already had false starts with other note-taking methods, such as the “commonplace book” Ryan Holiday espouses. So, I was motivated to persevere and get a good first-principles understanding of how best to construct a Zettelkasten for my workflow.
> 
> For sure, How to Take Smart Notes was the best resource I came across, but I still had a lot to figure out after reading it. So, I wrote and just released a short book (about 80 pages), full of everything I wish I could have known from the start. It’s called Digital Zettelkasten: Principles, Methods, & Examples.
> 
> It’s a guide that helps you think through building your digital Zettelkasten in a way that will turn your computer into a “bicycle for the mind.” And – something I always had trouble finding – it has real-world examples.. I hope my short book helps some zettlers get started faster than I did.

## *Effective Notetaking* by Fiona McPherson

*[Effective Notetaking](https://www.mempowered.com/books/effective-notetaking)* by Fiona McPherson

This insight-packed book has plenty of practical, actionable steps you can take to make your note-taking richer and more effective. The book was written for university students, but has applicable tips and tutorials for lifelong learners, too. Dr. McPherson uses an evidence-based, research-grounded approach to help improve your note-taking and retention skills.

## Author’s description of *Effective Notetaking*

> This workbook looks at the most important group of study strategies – how to take notes (with advice on how to read a textbook and how to prepare for a lecture).
> 
> You’ll be shown how to format your notes; use headings and highlighting; how to write different types of text summaries and pictorial ones, including concept maps and mind maps (you'll find out the difference, and the pros and cons of each); ask the right questions; make the right connections; review your notes; and, evaluate text to work out which strategy is appropriate.
> 
> There's advice on individual differences and learning styles, and on how to choose the strategies that are right for both you and the situation. Using effective notetaking strategies will help you remember what you read. It will help you understand more, and set you on the road to becoming an expert (or at least getting good grades!).
> 
> Successful studying isn’t about hours put in, it’s about spending your time wisely. You want to study smarter not harder. As always with the Mempowered books, this thorough (and fully referenced) workbook doesn't re-hash the same tired advice that's been peddled for so long. Rather, *Effective Notetaking* builds on the latest cognitive and educational research to help you study for success.
