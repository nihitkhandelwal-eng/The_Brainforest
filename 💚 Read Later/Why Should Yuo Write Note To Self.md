### 3 reasons you should consider writing a note to your next day self:

1.  It's a super-charged method of setting our intention.
2.  Separating our today self from our tomorrow self is a key element for growth.
3.  Learning to show respect for ourselves brings greater satisfaction with life and relationships.

### 6 "bumper guard" guidelines

1.  Address your tomorrow note with a neutral to affectionate salutation: "Dear (next day) (Name)
2.  If you're struggling to address your tomorrow self warmly, ask yourself why. Then use the endearment anyway.
3.  Own today's victories
4.  Acknowledge where you blew it today. Quickly, efficiently, and without judgment. Own it.
5.  Show ample grace for today and tomorrow selves.
6.  Sign your name, "Respectfully" or "Love" (day of the week) (your name).  
    *See the example below for how these 6 guidelines may look.*

#### Example

**(1)** Dear Wednesday Tracy,  
**(2)** It feels weird to address you warmly. I'm pretty put out with today Tracy.  
**(3)** I could list all of my today failures. Instead, I will acknowledge a couple of victories.
-   I was nice to the dog.
-   I listened more than I spoke.  

**(4)** For one thing, she drank too much coffee and now I'm jittery. Won't ever get to sleep tonight!  
**(5)** Tomorrow will be difficult because I probably won't get much sleep. Still, today Tracy's poor coffee decision-making skills will not be an excuse for slacking off, will it? Let's get up and get after it tomorrow. You can totally do this. Take frequent breaks to stretch. Walk the dog, thus continuing our "nice to the dog" streak.  
**(6)** Respectfully, Tuesday Tracy
