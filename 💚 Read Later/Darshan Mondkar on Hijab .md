Okay, those "Pehle Hijaab, Fir Kitaab" posters that are going viral on social media....

Those posters were put up in Beed, Maharashtra by the AIMIM, Owaisi wala.

You can clearly understand the political intentions behind this move.

Hijaab hai ya nahi hai, is irrelevant...... kitaab hona jaruri hai !!!!

Disclaimer: If you force them to take off Hijaab, I will be pro hijaab. If you force them to wear hijaab, I will be anti hijaab. Hijaab is not the problem.....your imposition is.
