### Morning Pages
- I am really good at resolving conflicts between Vihaan & Aanya, I am extremely awesome when it comes to them. Really proud of that.
- I think I can bring substantial change in their life.
- I am telling everyone I meet about the USMLE, it's not about not able to keep my things private, I am being honest, I told everyone about my depression things as well, I do it about everything. 
    - On the plus side, this is like public acountabiliity for me now.
- We will be going to Mamagoto today for dinner & I am so excited about it, I really cannot express it in words, but that is a reflection on my writing abilities than on my thinking. Maybe more of my thinking ability as well. 

### Good Morning
Slept late at 04:00 while listening to [[Sochta Hoon Ke Woh Kitne Masoom The]], onset was much quicker than usual, I don't remember any nightmares & I told Mami to let the kids wake me up at 08:00 & they did at 07:30, it was lovely, I played with both of them & had a fun half hour play time.
Planning & sorting out things so that I can have some sense of mental clarity.
One phrase to rule them all → Happy
Eagle's eye view → We had a good one day study period, let's not break that up again, hop on the productive train!
I can study for 4 hours today, that would be kinda bold
