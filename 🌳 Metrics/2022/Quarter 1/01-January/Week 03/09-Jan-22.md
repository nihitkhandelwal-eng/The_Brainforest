## Late Night Motivation
- Not in a very happy mood, she wished Jain on his birthday & said that I'm doing well & tells him to meet her when he goes to jaipur & he politely chats with her.
	- I know this will seem very kiddish even to me in a few years, but this hurts at the moment & as a result I masturbated twice & now I am listening to [[Sab Yaad Rakha Jaega]] & [[Main Inkaar Karta Hoon]]
	- It really pumps me up when he says & the funny thing is I relate to this in a different way now
		- "Sab kuch yaad rakha jaega, aur main apni haddiyon pe likhke rakhoonga ye saare vardaat, tum jo maangte ho mujhse mere hone ke kaagzaat, apni hasti ka tumko saboot zaroor dia jaega, sab yaad rakha jaega"
## Morning Pages
- Mami woke me up at 9:30, had broccoli omlette & Poha, talked to Moma.

- I feel very motivated today, not that I have done anything with it but I have not been doing anything for a long time, so that will take time
