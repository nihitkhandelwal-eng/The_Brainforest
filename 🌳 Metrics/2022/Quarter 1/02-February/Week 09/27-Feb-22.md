## Therapy Session #2 
- I am at Polaris Hospital, dot on time, it’s like I wait outside till it’s time, much like what Sheldon did with Amy.
- She is late today as well, I am inclined to go easy but then I feel that maybe Moma & Dad are right, I should speak up.
- Really excited to start a new week all over once again, I really have high hopes from the coming week.
