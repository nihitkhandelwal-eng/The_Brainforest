### Morning Pages
- I am not able to understand the beauty of gameplay, my mind is stuck somewhere about graphics, it has been that way, since Tomb Raider & leading to RDR2. 
- This is coming up since I am writing a review asked by Vihaan on minecraft in the shared vault, which I will share in this vault as well, or not, I am not sure.
- So, for that process I was watching reviews of minecraft & I came across a review from "Whitenoise"
    - I am already so complexed by this guy's passion for games & understanding of gameplay, when he started praising the game, I seriously thought that I missed out on something.
### Good Morning
Didn't want to sleep, so didn't sleep. I have a terrible headache & just not feeling well.
- Nothing
- One phrase to rule them all → undefined
- I can be cautious about
    - Everything is stressing me out, so maybe following my routine might help me relax for real, not like relax by denial but relaxation by improving.
- Eagle's eye view → You are genuinely good & extraordinary, don't give up.
- Daring Task → Do some actual work. Write. Think. Try to resist playing COC & watching True Detective.
