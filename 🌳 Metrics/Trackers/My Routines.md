After my 2nd session with Amandeep Ma'am, I am now on board with the thought that, unless you have a routine, things cannot fall in place. Routines can be dynamic as well but for now, I will stick to a basic routine that is relevant as of [[23-Sep-22]]

I will be tracking my routines in the weekly notes & I will make a template for them as well.
